 text. It does not apply to websites that have a lot of non-textual 
content. It also does not apply to websites that focus more on 
generating revenue or pleasing investors than being inclusive.</p>

				<p>I realize not everybody’s going to ditch the Web and switch to Gemini or Gopher today (<span data-literal="that would be a difficult and unrealistic transition">that’ll take, like, at least a month /s</span>).
 Until that happens, here’s a non-exhaustive, highly-opinionated list of
 best practices for websites that focus primarily on text. I don’t 
expect anybody to fully agree with the list; nonetheless, the article 
should have at least some useful information for any web content author 
or front-end web developer.</p>
				<p>My primary focus is <a href="https://100daysofa11y.com/2019/12/03/accommodation-versus-inclusive-design/">inclusive design</a>. Specifically, I focus on supporting <em>underrepresented ways to read a page</em>.
 Not all users load a page in a common web-browser and navigate 
effortlessly with their eyes and hands. Authors often neglect people who
 read through accessibility tools, tiny viewports, machine translators, 
“reading mode” implementations, the Tor network, printouts, hostile 
networks, and uncommon browsers, to name a few. I list more niches in <a href="#conclusion">the conclusion</a>.
 Compatibility with so many niches sounds far more daunting than it 
really is: if you only selectively override browser defaults and use 
plain-old, semantic HTML (<abbr title="plain-old, semantic HTML">POSH</abbr>), you’ve done half of the work already.</p>
				<p>One of the core ideas behind the flavor of inclusive design I present is <dfn id="inc-by-default" tabindex="-1">inclusivity by default</dfn>.
 Web pages shouldn’t use accessible overlays, reduced-data modes, or 
other personalizations if these features can be available all the time. 
Of course, some features conflict; you can’t display a light and dark 
color scheme simultaneously. Personalization is a fallback strategy to 
resolve conflicting needs. Dis­proportionately underrepresented needs 
deserve disproportionately greater attention, so they come before 
personal preferences instead of being relegated to a separate lane.</p>
				<p>Another focus is minimalism. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement">Progressive enhancement</a>
 is a simple, safe idea that tries to incorporate some responsibility 
into the design process without rocking the boat too much. I don’t find 
it radical enough. I call my alternative approach “restricted 
enhancement”.</p>
				<p><dfn>Restricted enhancement</dfn> limits all enhancements to 
those that solve specific accessibility, security, performance, or 
significant usability problems faced by people besides the author. These
 enhancements must be made progressively when possible, with a 
preference for using older or more widespread features, taking into 
account unorthodox user agents. Purely-cosmetic changes should be kept 
to a minimum.</p>
				<p>I’d like to re-iterate yet another time that this only applies to
 websites that primarily focus on text. If graphics, interactivity, etc.
 are an important part of your website, less of the article applies. My 
hope is for readers to consider a subset of this page the next time they
 build a website, and <em>address the trade-offs they make when they deviate.</em> I don’t expect—or want—anybody to follow all of my advice, because doing so would make the Web quite a boring place!</p>
				<p>I’ll cite the Web Accessibility Initiative’s (<abbr title="Web Accessibility Initiative">WAI</abbr>) <span class="h-cite" itemprop="citation" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/TechArticle"><cite itemprop="name" class="p-name"><a class="u-url" itemprop="url" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/">Techniques for WCAG 2.2</a></cite></span> a number of times. Each “Success Criterion” (requirement) of the WCAG has possible techniques. Unlike the <cite>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</cite> (<abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>), the Techniques document does not list requirements; rather, it serves to non-exhaustively educate authors about <em>how</em>
 to use specific technologies to comply with the WCAG. I don’t find much
 utility in the technology-agnostic goals enumerated by the WCAG without
 the accompanying technology-specific techniques to meet those goals.</p>
				<p>I’ll also cite <span class="h-cite" itemid="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/" itemprop="citation" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/TechArticle"><cite itemprop="name" class="p-name"><a class="u-url" itemprop="url" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/">Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities</a></cite>, by <span itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization" itemprop="publisher">the WAI</span></span>.

			<p>One of the defining differences between textual websites and 
advanced Web&nbsp;2.0 sites/apps is safety. Most browser vulnerabilities
 are related to modern Web features like JavaScript and WebGL. The 
simplicity of basic textual websites should guarantee some extra safety;
 however, webmasters need to take additional measures to ensure limited 
use of “modern” risky features.</p>
			<h3 id="tls" tabindex="-1">TLS</h3>
			<p>All of the simplicity in the world won’t protect a page from 
unsafe content injection by an intermediary. Proper use of TLS protects 
against page alteration in transit and ensures a limited degree of 
privacy. Test your TLS setup with <a translate="no" href="https://testssl.sh/">testssl.sh</a> and <a href="https://webbkoll.dataskydd.net/">Webbkoll</a>.</p>
			<p>If your OpenSSL (or equivalent) version is outdated or you don’t want to download and run a shell script, SSL Labs’ <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">SSL Server Test</a> should be equivalent to testssl.sh. Mozilla’s <a href="https://observatory.mozilla.org/">HTTP Observatory</a>
 offers a subset of Webbkoll’s features and is a bit out of date (and 
requires JavaScript), but it also gives a beginner-friendly score. Most 
sites should strive for at least a 50, but a score of 100 or even 120 
shouldn’t be too hard to reach.</p>
			<p>A false sense of security is far worse than transparent 
insecurity. Don’t offer broken TLS ciphers, including TLS 1.0 and 1.1. 
Vintage computers can run TLS 1.2 implementations such as BearSSL 
surprisingly efficiently, leverage a TLS terminator, or they can use a 
plain unencrypted connection. A broken cipher suite is security theater.</p>
			<h3 id="scripts-and-the-content-security-policy" tabindex="-1">Scripts and the Content Security Policy</h3>
			<p>Consider taking hardening measures to maximize the security 
benefits made possible by the simplicity of textual websites, starting 
with script removal.</p>
			<p>JavaScript and WebAssembly are responsible for the bulk of modern web exploits. If that isn’t reason enough, most <a href="https://seirdy.one/posts/2021/03/10/search-engines-with-own-indexes/">non-mainstream search indexes</a> have little to no support for JavaScript. Ideally, a text-oriented site can enforce a scripting ban at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">Content Security Policy</a> (<abbr title="Content Security Policy">CSP</abbr>) level.</p>
			<figure aria-labelledby="code-1" itemprop="hasPart" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/SoftwareSourceCode">

			</figure>
			<p><code>default-src: 'none'</code> implies <code>script-src: 'none'</code>, causing a compliant browser to forbid the loading of scripts. Furthermore, the <code>sandbox</code> CSP directive forbids a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/sandbox">wide variety of risky actions</a>. While <code>script-src</code> restricts script loading, <code>sandbox</code> can also restrict script execution with stronger defenses against script injection (e.g. by a browser add-on).<sup><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;1</a></sup> I added the <code>allow-same-origin</code> parameter so that signed scripts (e.g. from add-ons) will still be able to function.<sup><a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;2</a></sup></p>
			<p>If you’re able to control your HTTP headers, then use headers instead of a <code>&lt;meta http=equiv&gt;</code> tag. In addition to not supporting certain directives, a CSP in a <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag might let some items slip through.</p>

			<p>Please use progressive enhancement (<abbr title="progressive enhancement">PE</abbr>)<sup><a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;3</a></sup> throughout your site; every feature possible should be optional, and scripting is no exception.</p>
			<p>I’m sure you’re a great person, but your readers might not know 
that; don’t expect them to trust your website. Your scripts should look 
as safe as possible to an untrusting eye. Avoid requesting permissions 
or using <a href="https://browserleaks.com/javascript">sensitive APIs</a>.</p>
			<p>Finally, consider using your CSP to restrict script loading. If 
you must use inline scripts, selectively allow them with a hash or 
nonce. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/trusted-types">Some recent CSP directives</a> restrict and enforce proper use of <a href="https://web.dev/trusted-types/">trusted types</a>.</p>
			<h3 id="third-party-content" tabindex="-1">Third-party content</h3>
			<p>Third-party content will complicate the CSP, allow more actors to 
track users, possibly slow page loading, and create more points of 
failure. Some privacy-conscious users actually block third-party 
content: while doing so is fingerprintable, it can <a href="https://seirdy.one/posts/2022/06/25/two-types-of-privacy/">reduce the amount of data collected about an already-identified user</a>. Avoid third-party content, if at all possible.</p>
			<p>Some web developers deliver resources using a third-party content delivery network (<abbr title="content delivery network">CDN</abbr>),
 such as jsDelivr or Unpkg. Traditional wisdom held that doing so would 
allow different websites to re-use cached resources; however, <a href="https://privacycg.github.io/storage-partitioning/">mainstream browsers partition their caches</a> to prevent this behavior.</p>
			<p>If you must use third-party content, use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity">subresource integrity</a> (check the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/"><abbr title="Subresource Integrity">SRI</abbr> specification</a>).
 This prevents alteration without your consent. If you wish to be extra 
careful, you could use SRI for first-party resources too.</p>
			<p>Be sure to check the privacy policies for the third party services
 and subscribe to updates, as their practices could impact the privacy 
of all your users.</p>
			<p>For embedded third-party content (e.g. images), give extra consideration to the <a href="#beyond-alt-text">“Beyond alt-text” section</a>. Your page should be as useful as possible if the embedded content becomes inaccessible.</p>

			<p>Nearly every Internet user has to deal with unreliable connections
 every now and then, even the most privileged. Developing regions lack 
modern Internet infrastructure; high-ranking executives travel 
frequently. Everybody hits the worst end of the bell-curve.</p>
			<p>Reducing load time is especially useful to poorly-connected users.
 For much of the world, connectivity comes in short bursts during which 
loading time is precious. Chances of a connection failure or packet loss
 increase with time.</p>
			<p>Optimal loading is a complex topic. Broadly, it covers three 
overlapping categories: reducing payload size, delivering content early,
 and reducing the number of requests and round trips.</p>
			<h3 id="blocking-resources" tabindex="-1">Blocking resources</h3>
			<p>HTML is a blocking resource: images and stylesheets will not load 
until the user agent loads and parses the HTML that calls them. To start
 loading above-the-fold images before the HTML parsing finishes, send a <code>link</code> HTTP header.</p>

			<h3 id="dont-count-on-the-cache" tabindex="-1">Don’t count on the cache</h3>
			<p>The browser cache is a valuable tool to save bandwidth and improve
 page speed, but it’s not as reliable as many people seem to believe. 
Don’t focus too much on “repeat view” performance.</p>
			<p>Out of privacy concerns, most browsers no longer re-use cached content across sites; refer back to the <a href="#third-party-content">section on third-party content</a>
 for more details. Privacy-conscious users (including all users using 
“private” or “incognito” sessions) will likely have their caches wiped 
between sessions.</p>
			<p>Requesting a high number of cached resources can decrease performance of the cache, causing browsers to <a href="https://simonhearne.com/2020/network-faster-than-cache/">bypass the cache</a>.
 The effect is especially pronounced on low-end phones and mechanical 
hard drives. Firefox calls this feature “Race Cache With Network”, 
documented in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1358038">Mozilla Bug 1358038</a>.</p>
			<p>One way to help browsers decide which disk-cached resources to prioritize is to use immutable assets. Include the <code>immutable</code> directive in your <code>cache-control</code>
 headers, and cache-bust modified assets by changing their URLs. You can
 also keep your asset counts low by combining textual assets (e.g. CSS) 
and inlining small resources.</p>
			<figure aria-labelledby="code-3" itemprop="hasPart" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/SoftwareSourceCode">
				<figcaption id="code-3-caption"><span id="code-3" tabindex="-1"><strong itemprop="name"><span itemprop="codeSampleType">Code snippet</span> 3</strong></span>:

			</figure>
			<h3 id="inline-content" tabindex="-1">Inline content</h3>
			<p>In addition to HTML, CSS is also a blocking resource. You could pre-load your CSS using a <code>link</code> header. Alternatively: if your compressed CSS is under a kilobyte consider inlining it in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> using a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element. Simply inlining stylesheets can pose a security threat, but the <code>style-src</code> <abbr title="Content Security Policy">CSP</abbr> directive can mitigate this if you include a hash of your inline stylesheet sans trailing whitespace.</p>
			<p>Consider inlining images under 250&nbsp;bytes with a <code>data:</code>
 URI; that’s the size at which cache-validation requests might outweigh 
the size of the image. My 32-pixel PNG site icon is under 150&nbsp;bytes
 and inlines quite nicely. On this site’s hidden service, it’s often the
 only image on a page (the hidden service replaces SVGs with PNGs; see 
the section on <a href="#the-tor-browser">the Tor Browser</a>). Inlining
 this image and the stylesheet allows my hidden service’s homepage to 
load in a single request, which is a welcome improvement given the 
round-trip latency that plagues onion routing implementations.</p>
			<h3 id="transfer-size-and-user-flows" tabindex="-1">Transfer size and user flows</h3>

			</figure>
			<p>Here are some example flows that start with loading a homepage:<sup><a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;4</a></sup></p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>A homepage has a link to a list of pages in a category. Your 
reader loads the homepage, navigates to the list page, and then 
navigates to the target page.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>A homepage contains a link to a post which has “next post” and 
“previous post” links at the bottom. Your reader navigates to the post 
and clicks “next post” until they reach the target page.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>A homepage has a “search” box. The reader searches for the target page and clicks a result on the result page.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Assume one of your readers has caching enabled, but their current 
cache is empty. They have a link to your homepage. Your reader should be
 able to perform at least two different flows to reach a target page, 
starting with navigating to your homepage. The total size transferred 
across their entire flow is the metric worth optimizing, not the weight 
of a single page. Set a performance budget for this flow. A “home, posts
 list, target page” flow can take a user from my homepage to this page 
using under 150&nbsp;KiB.</p>
			<p>Data is a scarce resource on metered connections; don’t waste it 
on unnecessary information. At least half the data transferred across 
the flow should be semantically-meaningful compressed markup. Try 
testing a “lite” version of a page with non-semantic markup removed: 
strip any <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> 
elements, or attributes that don’t have semantic value. Compare this 
“lite” page’s compressed markup size with the total download size of an 
actual page. Do this for every page across a flow.</p>
			<p>I personally found this to be too much work. I skipped the 
creation of “lite” pages by removing non-semantic markup from my HTML: 
with the exception of utility classes that describe content rather than 
structure, my markup is made of semantically-relevant POSH, ARIA, 
Microdata, and microformats classes.<sup><a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;5</a></sup></p>
			<h3 id="core-web-vitals-arent-enough" tabindex="-1">Core Web Vitals aren’t enough</h3>
			<p>Download size matters, especially on metered connections. There’s 
no shortage of advice concerning minimizing this easy-to-understand 
metric. Unfortunately, it alone doesn’t give us the full picture: 
download size is not the exact same thing as time taken to deliver 
useful content to users.</p>
			<p>Google’s answer to this problem is “Core Web Vitals” containing metrics such as <a href="https://docs.webpagetest.org/metrics/speedindex/">the Speed Index</a>.
 These metrics aren’t useless, but they are incredibly naive: they only 
take into account user-perceivable speed with an emphasis on user 
engagement, placing too little emphasis a page’s actual resource use. 
Plenty of other factors exist.</p>
			<figure itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Quotation">

			<h3 id="round-trips" tabindex="-1">Round trips</h3>
			<p role="doc-tip">This sub-section is overkill for most use-cases.</p>
			<p>A supplementary metric to use alongside download size is round 
trips. Estimate the number of bytes and round-trips it takes to do the 
following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Begin downloading the final blocking resource</li>
				<li>Finish downloading all blocking resources</li>
				<li>Finish downloading two screenfuls of content</li>
				<li>Finish downloading the full page.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Understanding round-trips requires understanding your server’s approach to congestion control.</p>
			<p>Historically, TCP congestion control approaches typically set an 
initial window size to ten TCP packets and grew this value with each 
round-trip. Under most setups, this meant that the first round-trip 
could include 1460 bytes. The following round-trip could deliver under 
three kilobytes.<sup><a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;6</a></sup></p>
			<p>Nowadays, servers typically employ BBR-based congestion control. 
It allows for regular “spikes” in window size, but the initial window 
size is still small. Find more details in the slides from <span class="h-cite" itemprop="citation" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/PresentationDigitalDocument"><cite class="p-name" itemprop="name headline"><a class="u-url" itemprop="url" href="https://labs.apnic.net/presentations/store/2019-09-05-bbr.pdf">TCP and BBR</a></cite> (<span itemprop="encodingFormat">application/<wbr>pdf</span>) by <span itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person" class="h-card vcard p-author"><a itemprop="url" href="https://www.potaroo.net/" class="u-url url"><span itemprop="name" class="p-name fn n"><span itemprop="givenName" class="p-given-name given-name">Geoff</span> <span itemprop="familyName" class="p-family-name family-name">Huston</span></span></a>

			<p>HTTP/3 uses QUIC instead of TCP, which makes things a bit different; the important thing to remember is that <em>user agents should be aware of all blocking resources <strong>before</strong> finishing the earliest possible round-trip.</em></p>
			<h3 id="the-golden-kilobyte" tabindex="-1">The golden kilobyte</h3>
			<p>Assume that your first impression must fit in the first kilobyte.<sup><a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;7</a></sup> Make good use of this golden kilobyte; most or all of it will likely be taken up by HTTP headers.<sup><a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;8</a></sup>
 Ideally, the first kilobyte transferred should inform the client of all
 blocking resources required, possibly using preload directives; all of 
these resources can then begin downloading over the same multiplexed 
HTTP/2 connection before the current round-trip finishes! Note that this
 works best if you took <a href="#third-party-content">my advice to avoid third-party content</a>.</p>
			<p>Apply these strategies in moderation. Including extra preload 
directives in your document markup might not help as much as you think, 
since their impact on page size could negate minor improvements. 
Micro-optimizations have diminishing returns; past a certain point, your
 effort is better spent elsewhere.</p>
			<h3 id="layout-shifts" tabindex="-1">Layout shifts</h3>
			<p>Loading content of unknown dimensions, such as images, can create layout shifts; the <abbr title="Web Incubator Community Group">WICG</abbr>’s <cite><a href="https://wicg.github.io/layout-instability/#sec-intro">Layout Instability API</a></cite>
 describes the phenomenon in detail. Avoid layout shifts by including 
dimensions in HTML attributes. The simplest way to do so is by including
 unitless <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> values, but the <code>style</code> attribute could work too. I recommend staying away from the <code>style</code> attribute, or at least selectively allowing its use with the <code>style-src-attr</code> CSP directive.</p>
			<h3 id="other-server-side-tweaks" tabindex="-1">Other server-side tweaks</h3>
			<p>In-depth server configuration is a bit out of scope, so I’ll keep each improvement brief.</p>
			<p>Compression—especially static compression—dramatically reduces 
download sizes. My full-text RSS feed is about a quarter of a megabyte, 
but the Brotli-compressed version is about 70 kilobytes. Caddy supports 
this with a <code>precompressed</code> directive; Nginx requires the <a href="https://github.com/google/ngx_brotli">ngx_brotli module</a> for Brotli compression.</p>
			<p>When serving many resources at once (e.g., if a page has many 
images), HTTP/2 could offer a speed boost through multiplexing; use it 
if you can, but expect many clients to only support HTTP/1.1. HTTP/3 is 
unlikely to help textual websites much, so run a benchmark to see if 
it’s worthwhile.</p>
			<p>Consider caching static assets indefinitely with a year-long duration in their <code>cache-control</code> headers, possibly with an <code>immutable</code>
 parameter. If you have to update a static asset, cache-bust it by 
altering the URL. This approach should eliminate the need for an <code>etag</code> header on static assets.</p>
			<p>Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling">OCSP stapling</a>

 a DNS lookup and allowing them to instead re-use a connection.</p>

			<p>Many people use Tor out of necessity. On Tor, additional constraints apply.</p>
			<h3 id="constraints-of-the-tor-browser" tabindex="-1">Constraints of the Tor Browser</h3>
			<p>Tor users are encouraged to set the <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/en-US/security-settings/">Tor Browser’s security settings</a> to “safest”. This disables scripts, MathML, some fonts, SVG images, and <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbutton.git/tree/modules/security-prefs.js">other unsafe Firefox features</a>.
 If your site has any SVG images, the Tor browser will download these 
just like Firefox would (to avoid fingerprinting) but will not render 
them.</p>
			<p>Additionally, hopping between nodes in Tor circuits incurs 
latency, worsening the impacts of requiring multiple requests and 
round-trips. Try to minimise the number of requests to view a page.</p>
			<p>If you use a CDN or some overcomplicated website security stack, 
make sure it doesn’t block Tor users or require them to enable 
JavaScript to complete a CAPTCHA. Tor Browser users are supposed to 
avoid fingerprinting vectors like JS and browser extensions, so 
requiring a JavaScript-<wbr>based CAPTCHA will effectively block many Tor users.</p>
			<p>Tor users are unable to leverage media queries or client-hints to 
signal special needs. Pages need to be as accessible as possible by 
default, as per the <a href="#inc-by-default">“inclusive by default” directive outlined earlier</a>. This should be a given, but it’s doubly important when serving fingerprinting-averse readers.</p>
			<h3 id="hidden-services" tabindex="-1">Hidden services</h3>
			<p>To go above and beyond, try mirroring your site to a Tor hidden 
service to reduce the need for exit nodes. Mirroring allows you to keep a
 separate version of your site optimized for the Tor browser.</p>
			<p>Normally, optimizing specifically for a given user agent’s quirks 
(especially in a separate version of a website) is a bad practice; 
however, the Tor Browser is a special case because there’s no 
alternative available: Tor users should all use the same browser to 
avoid standing out. Sometimes, the Tor Browser pretends to have 
Firefox’s capabilities: progressive enhancement and graceful degradation
 won’t work when a browser lies about its functionality.</p>
			<p>For example, my website’s clearnet version uses some SVG images. 
Some browsers can’t handle a given image format. The typical solution is
 to use a <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element containing <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> children of varying formats and a fallback <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element using a legacy image format.</p>
			<p>The Tor browser will download whichever format Firefox would, rather than whichever formats it actually supports. A <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code>
 element containing an SVG and a raster fallback won’t help: the Tor 
browser will avoid fingerprinting by selecting the SVG format, not a 
fallback format. The image will not be rendered, so users will have 
downloaded the image only to see a white box.</p>
			<p>I address the issue by not using any SVG images on <a href="http://wgq3bd2kqoybhstp77i3wrzbfnsyd27wt34psaja4grqiezqircorkyd.onion/">my hidden service</a>.</p>

			<p>Lazy loading may or may not work. Some browsers, including Firefox
 and the Tor Browser, disable lazy-loading when the user turns off 
JavaScript. Turning it off makes sense because lazy-loading, like 
JavaScript, is a fingerprinting vector. Specifically, it identifies 
idiosyncratic scrolling patterns.</p>
			<figure itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Quotation">

					<p>Loading is only deferred when JavaScript is enabled. This is an

strategically placing images in a page's markup such that a server can 
track how many images are requested and when.</p>

			<p>If you can’t rely on lazy loading, your pages should work well 
without it. If pages work well without lazy loading, is it worth 
enabling?</p>
			<p>The scope of this article is textual content supplemented by 
images. In that context, I don’t think lazy loading is worthwhile 
because it often frustrates users on slow connections. I think I can 
speak for some of these users: mobile data near my home has a number of 
“dead zones” with abysmal download speeds, and my home’s Wi-Fi repeater 
setup used to result in packet loss rates surpassing 60%&nbsp;(!!).</p>
			<p>Users on poor connections have better things to do than idly wait 
for pages to load. They might open multiple links in background tabs to 
wait for them all to load at once, and/or switch to another task and 
come back when loading finishes. They might also open links while on a 
good connection before switching to a poor connection. For example, I 
often open several links on Wi-Fi before going out for a walk in a 
mobile-data dead-zone. A Reddit user reading an earlier version of this 
article described a <a href="https://i.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/k0dmpj/an_opinionated_list_of_best_practices_for_textual/gdmxy4u/">similar experience riding the train</a>.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, pages with lazy loading don’t finish loading 
off-screen images in the background. To load this content ahead of time,
 users need to switch to the loading page and slowly scroll to the end 
to ensure that all the important content appears on-screen and starts 
loading. Website owners shouldn’t expect users to have to jump through 
these ridiculous hoops.</p>
			<h3 id="against-speculative-pre-loading" tabindex="-1">Against speculative pre-loading</h3>
			<p>A common objection to my case against lazy-loading is that users 
may be more likely to click a link than scroll to the end, so pages 
should prioritize pre-loading the link. Pre-loading a page’s essential 
resources is fine. Speculatively pre-loading content on separate pages 
isn’t.</p>
			<p>Many users with poor connections also have capped data, and would 
prefer that pages don’t decide to predictively load many pages 
ahead-of-time for them. The overlap between these two groups grows 
especially pronounced as data cap overages trigger throttling; this is 
enough to trigger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220402004738/https://nitter.pussthecat.org/yoavweiss/status/1195036487538003968">a seasonal pattern in Japan</a>.</p>
			<p>Some go so far as to disable this behavior to avoid data overages.
 Savvy privacy-conscious users (including Tor Browser users) also 
generally disable speculative pre-loading since pre-loading behavior is 
fingerprintable.</p>
			<p>Users who click a link choose to download its contents, <a href="#transfer-size-and-user-flows">within a reasonable size limit</a>.
 Loading pages that a user hasn’t navigated to is making a choice for 
that user. I encourage adoption of “link” HTTP headers to pre-load 
essential and above-the-fold resources when possible, but doing so does 
not resolve the issues with lazy-loading: the people who are harmed by 
lazy loading are more likely to have pre-fetching disabled.</p>
			<p>Moreover, determining the pages to prioritize for speculative 
pre-loading typically requires analytics and/or A/B testing. Enrolling 
users in a study (e.g. by collecting information about their behavior) 
without prior informed consent <em>in terms they fully understand</em> 
demonstrates a disrespect for their autonomy. Furthermore: analytics 
typically represent all users equally, when developers should be giving 
disproportionate attention to marginalized users (e.g., disabled users).
 The convenience of the majority should not generally outweigh the needs
 of the minority. Many marginalized groups don’t wish to broadcast the 
fact that they have special needs, so don’t rely on being able to figure
 out who’s whom.</p>
			<h3 id="cant-users-on-poor-connections-disable-images" tabindex="-1">Can’t users on poor connections disable images?</h3>
			<p>I have two responses:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>If an image isn’t essential, don’t include it in the page. If an image is essential, assume sighted users want to see it.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Yes, users could disable images. That’s <em>their</em> choice. 
If your page uses lazy loading, you’ve effectively (and probably 
unintentionally) made that choice for a large number of users.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Nonetheless, expect some readers to have images disabled. Refer to <a href="#beyond-alt-text">the “Beyond alt-text” section</a> to see how to best support this case.</p>
			<h3 id="related-issues" tabindex="-1">Related issues</h3>
			<p>Pages should finish making all <code>GET</code> network requests 
while loading. This makes it easy to load pages in the background before
 disconnecting. I singled out lazy-loading, but other factors can 
violate this constraint.</p>
			<p>One example is pagination. It’s easier to download one long 
article ahead of time, but inconvenient to load each page separately. 
Displaying content all at once also improves searchability. The 
single-page approach has obvious limits: don’t expect users to happily 
download a single-page novel.</p>
			<p>Another common offender is infinite-scrolling. In addition to 
requiring JavaScript, infinite-scrolling also makes it difficult for 
readers to find their old place upon re-visiting a page. This creates 
harsh consequences for accidental navigation. WordPress documentation 
lists <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/markup/infinite-scroll/">more problems with infinite scrolling</a>.<sup><a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;9</a></sup></p>
			<p>A hybrid between the two is paginated content in which users click
 a “load next page” link to insert the next page at the end of the 
current page (typically using “dynamic content replacement”). It’s 
essentially the same as infinite scrolling, except additional content is
 loaded after a click rather than by scrolling. This is only slightly 
less bad than infinite scrolling; it still has the same fundamental 
issue of allowing readers to lose their place.</p>
			<p>I’ve discussed loading pages in the background, but what about saving a page offline (e.g. with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>)?
 While lazy-loading won’t interfere with the ability to save a complete 
page offline, some of these related issues can. Excessive pagination and
 inline scrolling make it impossible to download a complete page without
 manually scrolling or following pagination links to the end.</p>

			<h3 id="css-containment" tabindex="-1">CSS containment</h3>
			<p>Long pages with many DOM nodes may benefit from CSS containment, a more recently-adopted part of the CSS specification.<sup><a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;10</a></sup></p>
			<p><dfn>CSS containment</dfn> allows authors to isolate sub-trees of 
the DOM. This lets browsers make more informed optimizations: they can 
delay painting off-screen content or reduce re-calculations when 
isolated nodes change. Combined with a property like <code>content-visibility</code>, it enables browsers to defer all rendering of less essential below-the-fold content.</p>

			<p>Leveraging containment and <code>content-visibility</code> is a progressive enhancement, so there aren’t any serious implications for older browsers. I use <code>content-visibility</code>
 to defer rendering off-screen entries in my archives. Doing so allows 
me to serve long archive pages instead of resorting to pagination, with 
page-length limited only by download size. In my tests using Lighthouse 
with Chromium Devtools’ simulated CPU throttling,<sup><a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;11</a></sup> this article rendered faster <em>with</em> containment-enabled CSS than without any custom stylesheets at all.</p>

 safe. Using it for content earlier in the page risks introducing <a href="#layout-shifts">layout shifts</a>.

 describes how computing the accessibility tree can be expensive if a 
page has too many DOM nodes and custom elements. Browsers use complex 
heuristics to determine which elements to report, to reduce the size of 
the accessibility tree. Now that all major browsers are moving to 
multi-process architectures, some browser components interface with 
assistive technology (<abbr>AT</abbr>) in a separate process. Data about the page’s semantics needs to cross process boundaries, incurring additional overhead.</p>
			<p>Re-calculating nodes in the accessibility tree can create small 
delays for user interaction. These delays add up, causing the 
accessibility tree to fall out-of-sync with the actual page state. In 
extreme cases, an out-of-control accessibility tree may crash the <abbr>AT</abbr>.
 Moreover, speech synthesizers may be slow to start speaking when the 
CPU is under load. Delayed speech synthesis is incredibly annoying 
because it tends to omit words while “warming up”.</p>
			<p>When pages grow long, keep performance in check by doing the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Prefer semantic HTML over custom elements. The browser’s 
accessibility-tree-generation and element-filtering is optimized for 
semantic HTML; it has to do more guesswork to decipher custom elements.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Avoid scripts that delay user-input or cause complex DOM mutations. These will introduce delays that can cause significant <abbr>AT</abbr> usability issues.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Remember that CSS can impact the accessibility tree. Avoid using scripts to alter properties such as <code>display</code> and <code>visibility</code>.</p>

			<h3 id="the-importance-of-proofreading" tabindex="-1">The importance of proofreading</h3>
			<p>Correct, consistent spelling is important to readers who use 
search. In-page search doesn’t currently pick up misspelled words. If 
in-page search implementations develop such a feature, some users may 
wish to sometimes turn it off; even Google Search implemented a 
“verbatim” mode for exact matches.</p>
			<p>Moreover, some search implementations (such as the one built into 
Firefox) support case-sensitive matching. Inconsistent capitalization of
 proper nouns, acronyms, and initialisms can make searching difficult.</p>
			<h3 id="problematic-overrides" tabindex="-1">Problematic overrides</h3>
			<p>Search is so essential to some users’ ability to navigate that 
some desktop users enable “type-ahead” search, to automatically begin a 
search upon typing multiple characters.<sup><a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;12</a></sup>
 If you ignored my advice to avoid JavaScript, at least think twice 
before using it to define custom keyboard shortcuts which interfere with
 this type of functionality. I singled out type-ahead search, but there 
are countless other examples of uncommon keyboard behavior that 
JavaScript overrides interfere with.</p>
			<p>Another problematic override is scroll-behavior. Enforcing smooth-scrolling (e.g., with the <code>scroll-behavior</code>
 CSS property) can interfere with the use of in-page search by slowing 
down jumps between matches. Rapidly darting around the page with smooth 
scrolling can cause motion sickness. Simply relying on users to override
 default behaviors violates the “inclusive by default” directive I 
encourage, since user preferences are fingerprintable and shift 
responsibility away from developers.</p>
			<p>There’s a complex solution to <a href="https://schepp.dev/posts/smooth-scrolling-and-page-search/">turn off smooth scrolling for un-focused elements</a>, but it doesn’t address separate issues such as anchor-link navigation.</p>

			<p>I recommend setting the default font to <code>sans-serif</code>. <a href="https://infinnie.github.io/blog/2017/systemui.html"><code>system-ui</code> causes issues</a> among readers whose system fonts don’t cover your website’s charset.</p>
			<p>If you really want, you could use serif instead of sans-serif; 
however, serif fonts tend to look worse on low-res monitors. Not every 
screen’s <abbr title="Dots Per Inch">DPI</abbr> has three digits. Accommodate users’ default zoom levels by keeping your font size the same as most similar websites.</p>
			<p>To ship custom fonts is to assert that branding is more important 
than user choice. That might very well be a reasonable thing to do; 
branding isn’t evil! That being said, textual websites in particular 
don’t benefit much from branding. Beyond basic layout and optionally 
supporting dark mode, authors generally shouldn’t dictate the 
presentation of their websites; that should be the job of the user 
agent. Most websites are not important enough to look completely 
different from the rest of the user’s system.</p>
			<p>A personal example: I set my preferred browser font to <code>sans-serif</code>,
 and map it to my preferred font in my computer’s fontconfig settings. 
Now every website that uses sans-serif will have my preferred font. 
Sites with sans-serif blend into the users’ systems instead of sticking 
out.</p>
			<h3 id="but-most-users-dont-change-their-fonts" tabindex="-1">But most users don’t change their fonts…</h3>
			<p>The “users don’t know better and need us to make decisions for 
them” mindset isn’t without merits; however, in my opinion, it’s 
overused. Using system fonts doesn’t make your website harder to use, 
but it does make it smaller and stick out less to the subset of users 
who care enough about fonts to change them. This argument isn’t about 
making software easier for non-technical users; it’s about branding by 
asserting a personal preference.</p>
			<p>Moreover, third-party fonts may not always work. The Tor Browser’s
 “Safer” and “Safest” modes and iOS 16’s “Lockdown Mode” disable them. 
Content-blockers like Firefox Focus and uBlock Origin prominently expose
 remote-font toggles. If you ship remote fonts, you’ll need to test your
 site with remote <em>and</em> system fonts.</p>
			<h3 id="stylesheet-overrides-arent-an-excuse" tabindex="-1">Style­sheet overrides aren’t an excuse</h3>
			<p>It’s not a good idea to require users to automatically override 
website stylesheets to see their preferred fonts. Doing so would break 
websites that use fonts such as Font Awesome to display vector icons. We
 shouldn’t have these users constantly battle with websites the same way
 that many ad- and script-blocking users (myself included) already do 
when there’s a better option.</p>
			<p>That being said, many users <em>do</em> actually override stylesheets. We shouldn’t <em>require</em>
 them to do so, but we should keep our pages from breaking in case they 
do. Pages following this article’s advice will probably work perfectly 
well in these cases without any extra effort.</p>
			<h3 id="font-fingerprinting-concerns" tabindex="-1">Font fingerprinting concerns</h3>
			<p>Some people raised fingerprinting concerns when I suggested using 
the default “sans-serif” font. Websites could see which font this maps 
to in order to identify users.</p>
			<p>You can’t do font enumeration or accurately calculate font metrics
 without JavaScript. Since text-based websites that follow these 
best-practices don’t send requests after the page loads and have no 
scripts, they shouldn’t be able to fingerprint via font identification.</p>
			<p>Other websites can still fingerprint via font enumeration using 
JavaScript. They don’t need to stop at seeing what sans-serif maps to: 
they can see available fonts on a user’s system,<sup><a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;13</a></sup> the user’s canvas fingerprint, window dimensions, etc. Some of these can be mitigated by <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-protection-against-fingerprinting">Firefox’s protections against fingerprinting</a>, but these protections understandably override user font preferences.</p>
			<p>Ultimately, surveillance self-defense on the web is an arms race 
full of trade-offs. If you want both privacy and customizability, the 
web is not the place to look; try Gemini or Gopher instead.</p>
			<h3 id="zoom-and-font-size" tabindex="-1">Zoom and font size</h3>
			<p>Browsers allow users to zoom by adjusting size metrics. 
Additionally, most browsers allow users to specify a minimum font size. 
Minimum sizes don’t always work; setting size values in <code>px</code> can override these settings.</p>
			<p>In your stylesheets, avoid using <code>px</code> where possible. Define sizes and dimensions using relative units (preferably <code>em</code>). Exceptions exist for rare items that that shouldn’t scale with zoom (e.g. decoration, minimum margins).<sup><a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;14</a></sup></p>

			<p>Expect some readers to have images disabled or unloaded. Examples include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Blind readers.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Users with metered connections: sometimes they disable all images, and other times they only disable images surpassing a size.<sup><a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;15</a></sup></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>People experiencing packet loss who fail to download some images.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Users of textual browsers.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Accordingly, follow good practices for alt-text:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Concisely summarize the image content the best you can, without repeating the surrounding content.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Images should usually have alt-text under 100 ch.<sup><a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;16</a></sup> Save longer descriptions for a caption or <code>aria-<wbr>describedby</code>. Exceptions exist; this is just a weak norm.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Don’t include significant information that isn’t present in the 
image; I’ll cover how to handle supplementary information in the next 
subsections.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <abbr title="Web Accessibility Initiative">WAI</abbr> provides some guidelines in <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/">An <code>alt</code> Decision Tree</a></cite>.
 It’s a little lacking in nuance, but makes for a good starting point. 
Remember that guidelines and “good practices” always have exceptions.</p>
			<p>Alt text isn’t just for blind readers; sighted readers who can’t 
load an image will see alt-text in its place. This alt text might be 
confined to the image container, so small images should have shorter alt
 text.<sup><a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;17</a></sup></p>
			<h3 id="putting-images-in-context" tabindex="-1">Putting images in context</h3>
			<p>Alt text should be limited to describing content of the image. It 
lacks context. To make things worse, images can contain a great deal of 
information. Sighted people can “filter” this information and find areas
 to focus on; alt text should capture this detail. However, sighted 
users’ understanding of this detail can be informed by surrounding 
less-essential detail.</p>
			<p>Blind users might struggle to view images in context; they can’t 
easily scan the text before and after an image non-linearly if there’s 
no semantic connection between them. Charles McCathieNevile described 
this experience by comparing screen reading to <a href="#straw-analogy">reading through a drinking straw</a>.</p>
			<p>Being sighted and loading images can introduce issues of its own. Sometimes, sighted readers might focus on the <em>wrong</em> part of an image. How can you give readers the missing context and tell them what to focus on?</p>
			<p>The best solution comes in two parts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Before the image, supply context that prepares readers for what to expect.</li>
				<li>After the image, describe your interpretation of important details.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is somewhat similar to the way most students in primary and 
secondary schools are taught to cite evidence in essays. On that note: 
remember that these are weak norms, not rules. Deviate where 
appropriate, just as students should as they learn to write.</p>
			<h3 id="figures" tabindex="-1">Figures</h3>
			<p>A <dfn>figure</dfn> is any sort of self-contained information that
 is referenced by—but somewhat distinct from—body content. Items that 
make for good figures are often found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_layout#Floating_block">floating blocks</a> of print material.</p>
			<p>Consider using a <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element when 
employing the previous section’s two-part strategy. Place one of the two
 aforementioned pieces of information in a <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>; the caption can come before or after the image.</p>
			<p>Figures aren’t just for images; they’re for any self-contained referenced content that’s closer to the surrounding body than an <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>. Some example items that could use a caption:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Blockquote</dt>
				<dd>Captioned with a citation</dd>
				<dt>Code snippet</dt>
				<dd>Captioned with its purpose or a link to a the larger file from which the snippet was borrowed</dd>
				<dt>Mathematical notation</dt>
				<dd>Sometimes captioned with a brief explanation of its behavior, purpose, or significance. Remember to add alt-text.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Figures and captions have loose guidelines, and nearly everything I
 said on the matter is full of exceptions. A figure need not have a 
caption, but the majority benefit from one. It need not contain a single
 main element, but most probably should.</p>
			<p>I personally try to maintain the flow of an article even if its 
figures and captions are completely removed or moved to an appendix. A 
figure is a “self-contained” block: user agents may re-position figure 
captions relative to the main figure content, or move the entire figure 
elsewhere; this is especially common in <a href="#non-browsers-reading-mode">reading-mode implementations</a>. The HTML specification explicitly notes this behavior; <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc’s</a> HTML-to-LaTeX conversion and <a href="https://www.printfriendly.com/">PrintFriendly</a> are examples of software that move figure elements around to improve pagination.</p>
			<figure itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Quotation">
				<blockquote itemprop="text">
					<p>When a <code>figure</code> is referred to from the main content of the document by identifying
it by its caption (e.g., by figure number), it enables such content to be easily moved away from
that primary content, e.g., to the side of the page, to dedicated pages, or to an appendix,
without affecting the flow of the document.</p>
					<p>If a <code>figure</code> element is referenced by its relative position, e.g.,
"in the photograph above" or "as the next figure shows", then moving the figure would disrupt the
page's meaning. Authors are encouraged to consider using labels to refer to figures, rather than
using such relative references, so that the page can easily be restyled without affecting the
page's meaning.</p>

			<h3 id="image-transcripts" tabindex="-1">Image transcripts</h3>
			<p>Some images contain text. I describe best practices for preparing pictures of text in <a href="#pictures-of-text">the “Pictures of text” section</a>.
 Only use pictures of text if the visual appearance of the text is an 
essential part of what you wish communicate. If the content of the text 
is also important, include a transcript.</p>
			<p>Image transcripts aren’t just useful for the visually impaired; they also help users relying on <a href="#machine-translation">machine-translation</a>,
 since translation tools rely on textual content. These users won’t read
 alt-text; have an alternative way to discover a transcript.</p>
			<p>If the image is a screenshot of text from a website, link to that 
website to allow users to read its contents in context; this can serve 
as an “image transcript” of sorts.</p>
			<p>A <dfn><code>longdesc</code></dfn> attribute used to be another way to reference an image transcript. The <code>longdesc</code> attribute contained a hyperlink (often an anchor link) to a location with more information about an image. This attribute <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/obsolete.html#non-conforming-features">has been obsoleted</a> in the HTML Living Standard.</p>
			<p>The recommended way to link to a transcript is by hyperlinking the image (i.e., wrapping it with <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>)
 or semantically grouping the image with its transcript. Put a short 
summary in the alt-text, and mention the availability of a transcript in
 a visible caption.</p>
			<p>A <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65564539/what-is-the-semantically-correct-way-to-include-transcript-from-a-comic">StackOverflow thread about comic transcripts</a>
 outlines a good approach to semantically grouping images and 
transcripts, and my approach is similar. I group an image, alt-text, and
 caption in a <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element and follow it with a transcript in a <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element. I use <code>aria-<wbr>describedby</code> to semantically link the figure and the transcript.<sup><a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;18</a></sup></p>
			<p>An image, alt-text, figure caption, and transcript combine to form
 a complex relationship that should be grouped together in a single 
landmark. I put all three inside a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> with a heading, and give the group an <code>aria-label</code> that indicates the presence of the three sub-elements. Using a <code>section</code> landmark ensures that the figure and caption remain together as a single unit. The <a href="#xkcd-html">html code</a> for the <a href="#infinite-scrolling">xkcd comic earlier in the page</a> is a representative example.</p>

			<p>Always remember that any color palette you define in your 
stylesheets is merely a suggestion. Any colors you don’t define could 
fall back to arbitrary defaults; all colors you define could be 
overridden by the user agent or operating system.</p>
			<h3 id="default-colors" tabindex="-1">Default colors</h3>
			<p>Some users’ browsers set default page colors that aren’t 
black-on-white. For instance, Linux users who enable GTK style overrides
 might default to having white text on a dark background. Websites that 
explicitly set foreground colors but leave the default background color 
(or vice-versa) end up being difficult to read. The same phenomenon 
occurs on pages with text foregrounds with image backgrounds.</p>

			<h3 id="color-overrides-and-accessibility" tabindex="-1">Color overrides and accessibility</h3>
			<p>Even if you set custom colors, ensure that the page is compatible 
with color overrides: elements shouldn’t be distinguished solely by 
foreground and background color. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/css/C25">Technique C25</a> for the <cite>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>)&nbsp;2.2</cite> describes how doing so can meet the WCAG&nbsp;2.2’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/visual-presentation">Success Criterion&nbsp;1.4.8</a>.
 Specifically, it describes using default colors in combination with 
visible borders. The latter helps distinguish elements from surrounding 
content without relying on a custom color palette.</p>
			<p><a href="https://seirdy.one/posts/2020/11/23/website-best-practices/">This page’s canonical location</a> is an example application of Technique C25 (and the related <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G148">Technique G148</a>). It only uses non-default colors when a user agent requests a dark color scheme (using the <code>prefers-color-scheme</code>
 CSS media query; see the next subsection) and for lightening borders. 
Any image with a solid background may match the page background; to 
ensure that their dimensions are clear, I surrounded them with borders. 
Most browsers will render these borders with the default foreground 
color, which should be visually distinct from the background. I included
 borders and/or horizontal rules to break up some sections, since 
heading-based delineation is either unavailable or insufficient for 
them. When overriding color schemes, the page layout remains clear.</p>
			<p>Color overrides go well beyond simple foreground and background color changes. Windows High Contrast Mode (<abbr title="Windows High Contrast Mode">WHCM</abbr>) is perhaps the best example. <a href="#win-hcm">WHCM makes advanced modifications to color palettes</a>: it colors elements with a user-specified palette, all according to semantic markup while ignoring ARIA overrides.<sup><a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;19</a></sup></p>
			<p><abbr title="Windows High Contrast Mode">WHCM</abbr> leads the standardization process for the <code>forced-colors</code> CSS media feature, but it isn’t the only implementation of the underlying idea. If you navigate to <samp>about:preferences</samp> in Firefox and activate the <samp translate="yes">Colors</samp> button in the “Language and Appearance” section, you’ll be presented with the option to override website palettes with <a href="#default-colors">your own default colors</a>.</p>
			<p>Not all approaches completely discard a designer’s specified color
 palette. The CSS Working Group is working on a specification for 
stylesheet processing in <span class="h-cite" itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/TechArticle"><cite itemprop="name headline" class="p-name"><a class="u-url" itemprop="url" href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-adjust-1/">CSS Color Adjustment Module Level 1</a></cite></span>. The Chromium team’s in-progress <a href="https://chromestatus.com/feature/5672533924773888">auto dark mode</a> will use this specification to darken websites globally. Websites can opt out with the <code>color-scheme</code> property, but they really shouldn’t have to: stylesheets should be robust enough to handle re-coloring.</p>

			<p>If you do explicitly set colors, please also include a dark theme using a media query: <code>@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)</code>. For more info, read the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme"><code>prefers-color-scheme</code> docs on MDN</a>. Dark themes are helpful for readers with migraines, photosensitivity (like me!), or dark environments.</p>
			<p>If you include a <code>theme-color</code> directive in your document <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>,
 then recent browsers will automatically switch their default 
stylesheets to dark-mode. Unfortunately, some older browsers (like 
Firefox-ESR) don’t support this directive, and WebKit’s default dark 
stylesheet <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=209851">has unreadable links</a>.
 WebKit versions in the wild are often out of date, so a fixed 
stylesheet would need to be out for many years before I would consider 
using default dark stylesheets.</p>

			<p>“Just disable dark mode” is a poor response to users complaining 
about halation: it ignores the utility of dark themes described at the 
beginning of this section.</p>
			<p>If you can’t bear the thought of parting with your solid-black 
background, worry not: there exists a CSS media feature and client-hint 
for contrast preferences called <code>prefers-contrast</code>. It takes the parameters <code>no-preference</code>, <code>less</code>, and <code>more</code>. You can serve increased-contrast pages to those who request <code>more</code>, and vice versa. Check section 11.3 of the W3C <span class="h-cite" itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/TechArticle"><cite itemprop="name headline" class="p-name"><a class="u-url" itemprop="url" href="https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/#prefers-contrast">Media Queries Level 5</a></cite></span> specification for more information.</p>
			<p>I personally like a foreground and background of <code>#E9E9E9</code> and <code>#191919</code>, respectively. These shades seem to be as far apart as possible without causing accessibility issues: <code>#191919</code>
 is barely bright enough to create a soft “glow” capable of minimizing 
halos among slightly astigmatic users, but won’t ruin contrast on cheap 
displays. I also support a <code>prefers-contrast: less</code> media query which lightens the background to <code>#333</code>.<sup><a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;20</a></sup></p>
			<h3 id="contrast-is-complex" tabindex="-1">Contrast is complex</h3>
			<p>Color is a nuanced topic that deserves more attention than current guidelines give.</p>
			<p>When setting colors, especially for a dark background, I recommend
 checking your page’s contrast using Accessible Perceptual Contrast 
Algorithm (<abbr title="Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm">APCA</abbr>) values. You can do so in an <a href="https://www.myndex.com/APCA/">online APCA checker</a>
 (requires JavaScript) or Chromium’s developer tools (you might have to 
enable them in a menu for experimental preferences). I recommend using 
the web app.</p>
			<p>The APCA takes several factors into account:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>The human retina has few blue-sensitive cone cells, so blue appears “darker” than green and red. Yellow appears brightest.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Small, thin fonts are difficult to see and require greater contrast.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>It’s possible to have too much contrast, especially for 
large/bold text (note that the APCA version built into Chromium does not
 yet take this into account).</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Note that <a href="https://yatil.net/blog/wcag-3-is-not-ready-yet">the APCA isn’t fully mature</a>
 as of early 2022. Until version 3.0 of the WCAG is ready, pages that 
are required to comply with the WCAG should also conform to the contrast
 ratios described in the WCAG&nbsp;2.2’s success criteria 1.4.3 
(Contrast: Minimum, level AA) or 1.4.6 (Contrast: Enhanced, level AAA). 
This site’s dark-mode stylesheet is an example of a palette that 
conforms to both the WCAG&nbsp;2.2 AAA contrast requirements and APCA 
recommendations.</p>
			<p>Even if the APCA is much better than the WCAG’s current naive 
contrast algorithms, it still doesn’t account for all aspects of the 
relationship between perceptual contrast and color. <a href="https://github.com/Myndex/SAPC-APCA/discussions/74">Discussion no. 74 on the SAPC-APCA repository</a> covers some shortcomings. For instance, the current APCA version does not account for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz%E2%80%93Kohlrausch_effect">the Helmholtz–Kohlrausch effect</a>:
 highly-saturated colors appear “brighter” than de-saturated colors with
 the same brightness. Excessive perceptual brightness against dark 
backgrounds can trigger halation, eye-strain, and overstimulation.</p>
			<p>Yellow may have great contrast on dark backgrounds, but vivid yellow and red can cause problems among <a href="https://www.tpgi.com/beyond-wcag-losing-spoons-online/">people who deal with overstimulation</a>; this includes <a href="https://www.experia.co.uk/blog/ultimate-guide-to-autism-friendly-colours/">many on the autism spectrum</a>.
 If you want to use yellow and red, de-saturate them so that their color
 feels muted. This site’s dark theme uses pale, washed-out yellow and 
pink for maximum contrast with minimal harshness.</p>
			<p>Accounting for halation, overstimulation, and high-contrast needs 
is hard to do if you prioritize minute aesthetics before inclusivity.</p>
			<h3 id="contrast-under-different-conditions" tabindex="-1">Contrast under different conditions</h3>
			<p>Color palettes need to be effective for different types of vision 
deficiencies (e.g. color blindnesses) and screens. Color blindness is a 
far more nuanced topic than “the inability to see some colors”. <span class="h-cite" itemprop="citation" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting"><span itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person" class="h-card vcard p-author"><a itemprop="url" href="http://herpolhode.com/rob/" class="u-url url"><span itemprop="name" class="p-name fn n"><span itemprop="givenName" class="p-given-name given-name">Rob</span> <span itemprop="familyName" class="p-family-name family-name">Pike</span></span></a></span> describes his experience in <cite itemprop="name headline" class="p-name"><a class="u-url" itemprop="url" href="https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2020/09/color-blindness-is-inaccurate-term.html">Color blindness</a></cite></span>.
 Color blindness manifests in complex ways. Testing in grayscale is a 
great start, but it doesn’t account for all kinds of color vision 
deficiencies.</p>
			<p>Different screens and display-calibrations render color 
differently; what may look like a light-gray on a cheap monitor could 
look nearly black on a high-end OLED screen. Try to test on both high- 
and low-end displays, especially when designing a dark color scheme.<sup><a href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;21</a></sup></p>
			<p>Color schemes should also look good to users who apply gamma 
adjustments. Most operating systems and desktop environments bundle a 
feature to reduce the screen color temperature at night, while some 
individuals may select a higher one in the morning.</p>

			<p>In addition to <a href="#non-interactive-space">offering ample non-interactive space</a>,
 ensure that non-interactive and interactive regions are visually 
distinct. Avoid making interactive elements with many children.</p>
			<p>GitHub’s mobile website is a serious offender; see <a href="#gh-interactive">this screenshot of the GitHub bug tracker</a>
 for an example. The background region of the visible issue is 
interactive, and so are its contents. However, the header of the issues 
list has a non-interactive background that looks the same. Visual 
appearance does not convey the difference between a button and a 
hyperlink. The “enhancement” link points to a unique location, yet it 
loses its interactivity on narrow viewports with no visual change; 
tapping it navigates to a different location depending on viewport 
width.</p>

			<p>Screen readers like iOS VoiceOver<sup><a href="#fn:23" id="fnref:23" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;23</a></sup>
 fail to follow in-page links whose targets are not focusable. Designers
 often work around this by annotating link targets with the <code>tabindex="-1"</code> HTML attribute. This is a good idea when a link target is a heading or piece of <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/dom.html#phrasing-content">phrasing content</a>. Unfortunately, making large containers focusable ruins keyboard-navigability.</p>
			<p>Normally, if you select some text in a page and press <kbd>Tab</kbd>, the tab-focusable element <em>after</em>
 the selected text will receive focus. However, if the selectable text 
is inside a focusable container—even a container with a negative <code>tabindex</code>—pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> will move focus to the <em>start</em>
 of the container. If you’re reading this on a desktop browser, you can 
experience this first-hand: select some text in this paragraph and press
 <kbd>Tab</kbd>. Then, do the same in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220808163715/https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/06/voice-control-usability-considerations-partially-visually-hidden-link-names/">this snapshot of an excellent <em>Smashing Magazine</em> article</a>.<sup><a href="#fn:24" id="fnref:24" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;24</a></sup></p>

avoid the command line while performing lossy compression can instead 
check out <a href="https://squoosh.app/">Squoosh</a>, a JavaScript app that bundles Web­Assembly-compiled encoders; I’ve heard good things about it.</p>
			<p>You also might want to use the HTML <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> 
element, using JPEG/PNG as a fallback for more efficient formats such as
 WebP or AVIF, but only if the size savings (or quality improvements at a
 similar size) are significant. More info is in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture">MDN <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> docs</a></p>
			<p>Most of my images will probably be screenshots that start as PNGs. My typical flow:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Re-size and crop the PNG. Convert to grayscale if color isn’t important.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Lossy compression with <code>pngquant</code></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Losslessly optimize the result with <code>oxipng</code> and its Zopfli backend (slow)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Also create a lossless WebP from the lossy PNG and a lossy WebP from the source image, using <code>cwebp</code>. Pick the smaller of the two.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Include the resulting WebP in the page, with a fallback to the PNG using a <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Create a lossy AVIF image from the cropped full-color PNG, and include it in the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element if it’s smaller than the WebP. If color isn’t important, use the YUV400 color space.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>If the image is too light, repeat for a dark version of the image to display in response to a <code>prefers-color-scheme: dark</code> media query.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In general, avoid loading images just for decoration. Only use an 
image if it has a clear purpose that significantly adds to the content 
in a way that text can’t replace, and provide alt-text as a fallback. 
Any level of detail that isn’t necessary for getting the point across 
should be removed by lossy compression and cropping.</p>
			<p>If you want to include a profile photo (e.g., if your website is part of the IndieWeb and uses an <a href="https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card">h-card</a>),
 I recommend re-using one of your favicons. Doing so should be harmless 
since most browsers will fetch and cache favicons anyway.</p>

			<h3 id="breaking-conventional-wisdom" tabindex="-1">Breaking conventional wisdom</h3>
			<p>Some conventional wisdom for image compression doesn’t hold up 
when compressing this aggressively; for instance, I’ve found that 
extremely aggressive dithering and PNG compression of small 
black-and-white images consistently surpasses JPEG compression.</p>
			<p>Most resources on image optimization recommend considering 
progressive rendering. I don’t recommend progressive rendering for 
below-the-fold images; if you optimize an image to just a few kilobytes,
 it should fully load in time. It’s not worth the overhead for resources
 of less than 20&nbsp;kb.</p>
			<p>These resources also encourage authors to include different image 
variants for different viewport sizes, screen resolutions, and pixel 
densities. They often skip the caveats:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Using different image files for different viewport sizes can 
cause the page to request more images as users re-size their window.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Sending requests dependent on viewport and display 
characteristics is a fingerprinting vector, allowing servers to identify
 users by these properties.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Rather than create separate lanes for different users, I prefer 
making the defaults as inclusive as possible. A single image should look
 good under a variety of downscaling algorithms. It should be as small 
as it can be without losing essential information.</p>
			<p>It might seem odd to create a lossless WebP from a lossy PNG, but 
I’ve found that it’s often the best way to get the smallest possible 
image at the minimum acceptable quality for screenshots containing solid
 backgrounds.</p>
			<h3 id="dark-image-variants" tabindex="-1">Dark image variants</h3>
			<p>Bright images on an otherwise dark page distract readers, 
especially readers like me with ADHD. The human iris adjusts to average 
amounts of light; an object far brighter than its surroundings causes 
eye strain even among readers with healthy vision.</p>
			<p>A <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element allows selection of sources
 based on any CSS media query. When images have light backgrounds, I 
like to include dark variants to complement a dark stylesheet using an 
HTML <code>media</code> attribute: it selects a dark variant when the user has selected dark mode and is using a <code>screen</code> media type. Requiring the <code>screen</code>
 media type prevents selection of dark variants when printing. Printer 
paper is almost always white, so dark images could waste ink. Ink waste 
is a sensitive issue among many students: school printers sometimes 
charge students who exceed a given ink quota. Ask me how I know!</p>
			<p>Light and dark variants of legacy formats (PNG, JPG, GIF), WebP, and AVIF can cause some of my <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code>
 imagesets to have up to six image variants. I could fully automate the 
process using my static site generator (Hugo) if I wanted to. Since I do
 want to inspect each image and compress to the minimum acceptable 
quality, I settled for partial automation using shell scripts and <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~seirdy/seirdy.one/tree/master/layouts/shortcodes/picture.html">a Hugo shortcode</a>.</p>

			<h3 id="svg-images" tabindex="-1">SVG images</h3>
			<p>I only recommend using SVG in images; avoid using them in embeds, 
objects, or directly in the body. Remember that users may save images, 
and open them in a non-browser image viewer with reduced SVG 
compatibility. To maintain maximum compatibility, stick a the subset of 
the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/conform.html#secure-static-mode">secure static processing mode</a> of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/feature#SVG-static">SVG Static</a>. Specifically, the subset that appears in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-svg-tiny-ps-abrotman/">SVG Tiny Portable<wbr>/Secure (<abbr title="Portable/Secure">PS</abbr>) spec</a>. SVG Tiny PS is a subset of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/intro.html">SVG Tiny&nbsp;1.2</a>,
 which is a supported export format in most vector drawing programs. 
Ignore the elements specifically required for SVG Tiny PS; your image 
can be a standard SVG that only utilizes a tiny subset of the full SVG 
spec.</p>
			<p>This advice might seem daunting, but it’s usually easy to use 
existing tools to generate an SVG Tiny file and manually edit it to 
support the SVG secure static mode. SVGs that conform to this subset 
should be compatible with Qt5’s SVG implementation, librsvg (used by 
Wikipedia and GNOME), and most operating systems’ icon renderers. 
Moreover, tools like <a href="https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg/tree/master/usvg">usvg</a> can simplify complex SVGs to <a href="https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg/blob/master/docs/usvg_spec.adoc">a tiny subset of the SVG spec</a>.</p>
			<p>Two tools that can optimize the size of an SVG file are <a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo">SVGO</a> and the now-discontinued <a href="https://github.com/RazrFalcon/svgcleaner">svgcleaner</a>. Too much lossy SVG compression can sometimes <em>reduce</em> the effectiveness of gzip and Brotli compression. Compress in moderation.</p>

			<aside role="none">
				<a href="#layout" aria-labelledby="layout-prefix layout">
					<span id="layout-prefix">Permalink to section</span>
				</a>
			</aside>
			<p>Page layout should be simple, predictable, consistent, familiar, 
and static. Avoid anything too unusual, since novelty could introduce a 
learning curve.</p>
			<h3 id="accessible-skimming" tabindex="-1">Accessible skimming</h3>
			<p>Keep the source order, DOM order, and visual order identical to 
ensure consistent behavior when navigating with the mouse, keyboard, 
assistive-technology, et al. Doing so should also result in a logical <kbd>Tab</kbd> order.</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#navigable">Guideline 2.4 Navigable</a> of the WCAG lists multiple criteria related to identifying and skipping sections of your pages, and for good reason:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Users of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_access">switch access controls</a> find it slow and frustrating to navigate long lists of focusable items.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Screen readers make it difficult to consume poorly-organized content non-linearly.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Clients that don’t support CSS can’t prioritize content using a supplied stylesheet.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The list goes on: nearly every reader reliant upon assistive technologies (<abbr title="assistive technology">AT</abbr>) struggles to skim through poorly-organized pages.</p>
			<p>Related items need to be semantically grouped together. Group navigation links together in <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> elements; sections under headings and landmarks; lists under <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>; etc. to give assistive technologies the means to skip over multiple items at once.</p>
			<p>The first or second heading in the DOM, and the highest heading 
level, should be the page title marking the start of your main content 
(i.e. it should come after the site title, site navigation links, etc). 
Use elements like <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> to provide landmarks. If multiple navigation elements exist, give your main navigation element an <code>aria-label</code> or a heading.</p>
			<p>Remember that not all landmarks are announced by screen readers; 
for instance, many screen readers don’t announce the ending of a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element in an article. An <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>
 element is a good way to force the ending of a landmark to be visible: 
it introduces a thematic break between sections that is visible to 
assistive technologies and user-agents that don’t support CSS.</p>
			<p>Consider adding a “skip link” if some pages require many <kbd>Tab</kbd> keystrokes to reach the main content.<sup><a href="#fn:27" id="fnref:27" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;27</a></sup>
 Visually-impaired users generally prefer navigating by headings or 
landmarks, but screen reader beginners and motor-impaired users still 
benefit from a skip link. Skip links are especially helpful when pure 
heading- and landmark-based navigation isn’t optimal.</p>
			<p>If your skip link toggles visibility states when focused, ensure that it doesn’t move any existing content; see <a href="#layout-shifts">the “Layout shifts” section</a>
 for more details. If it appears over existing content, it needs to have
 a solid background; if you set the background color, set a foreground 
color too as described in <a href="#about-custom-colors">the “About custom colors” section</a>.</p>
			<h3 id="friendly-navigation" tabindex="-1">Friendly navigation</h3>
			<p>Users of <abbr title="assistive technology">AT</abbr>s such as 
screen readers primarily navigate through landmarks, headings, and 
paragraphs. Sometimes they also navigate between links. Headings and 
link names need to be unique and descriptive enough to serve as 
navigational aids; paragraphs shouldn’t be too long.</p>
			<p>Try using a tool to view a list of all your link names. Just about
 every screen reader and some browser extensions should offer this 
functionality. Minimize links with ambiguous names, and ensure that 
identical link names have identical destinations.</p>
			<p>Think twice before placing important content immediately after 
skippable content such as nested landmarks, long code snippets, figures,
 and large lists. AT users who wish to skip content may jump directly to
 the next heading, glossing over anything between the skippable content 
and subsequent heading; this is especially common on mobile devices.<sup><a href="#fn:28" id="fnref:28" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;28</a></sup> When it makes sense to do so, place skippable content in its own sections and/or at the end of its parent section.</p>
			<h3 id="single-column-layout" tabindex="-1">Single-column layout</h3>
			<p>The remainder of the “Layout” section is possibly the most 
subjective part of this article, and the part with the most exceptions. 
Consider it more of a weak suggestion than hard advice. Use your own 
judgement.</p>
			<p>A simple layout looks good at a variety of window sizes, rendering
 responsive layout changes unnecessary. Textual websites really don’t 
need more than a single column; readers should be able to scan a page 
top-to-bottom, side-to-side exactly once to read all its content.</p>
			<p>Verify this using the horizontal-line test: mentally draw a 
horizontal line across your page, and make sure it doesn’t intersect 
more than one landmark. Ideally it shouldn’t intersect multiple 
different <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/grouping-content.html">grouping elements</a> either. The “source order viewer” in Chromium’s DevTools can assist with this process.</p>
			<p>Keeping a single-column layout that doesn’t require responsive 
layout changes ensures smooth window re-sizing. Doing so while keeping 
an identical source, DOM, and visual order ensures layout consistency: 
spatial references such as “the paragraph above this heading” or “the 
bottom image of a section” will be unambiguous to screen reader, phone, 
and desktop users. It also ensures that selection behavior and caret 
movements during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret_navigation">caret navigation</a> remain predictable. Achieving this type of layout entails using the WCAG&nbsp;2.2 techniques <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/css/C27.html">C27: Making the DOM order match the visual order</a></cite> as well as <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/css/C6">C6: Positioning content based on structural markup</a></cite>.</p>
			<p>Nontrivial use of width-selectors, in CSS queries or imagesets, is actually a powerful vector for <a href="https://matt.traudt.xyz/posts/2016-09-04-how-css-alone-can-help-track-you/">JS-free fingerprinting</a>. This is one of the reasons why I didn’t recommend resolution- or dimension-aware imagesets in the <a href="#image-optimization">image optimization section</a>.</p>
			<p>Exceptions exist: one or two very simple responsive changes won’t 
hurt. The main anti-patterns are adjusting the relative order of 
elements, layout shifts dramatic enough to cause confusion, and making 
requests based on media queries that reveal fingerprintable information.</p>
			<h3 id="sidebar-pitfalls" tabindex="-1">Sidebar pitfalls</h3>
			<p>Sidebars are probably unnecessary, and can be quite annoying to 
readers who re-size windows frequently. This is especially true for 
tiling window manager users like me: we frequently shrink windows to a 
fraction of their original size. When this happens to a website with a 
sidebar, one of two things happens:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>The site’s responsive design kicks in: the sidebar vanishes and 
its elements move elsewhere. This can be quite CPU-heavy, as the browser
 has to both re-wrap the text and handle a complex layout change. 
Frequent window re-sizers will experience lag and battery loss, and 
might need a moment to figure out where everything went.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The site doesn’t use responsive design. The navbar and main 
content are now squeezed together. Readers will probably close the page.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Neither situation looks great.</p>
			<p><span class="h-cite" itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/TechArticle"><cite itemprop="name headline" class="p-name"><a class="u-url" itemprop="url" href="https://w3c.github.io/low-vision-a11y-tf/requirements#maintain-point-of-regard">Low Vision User Accessibility Requirements</a></cite> by the <abbr itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization" itemprop="publisher" title="Web Accessibility Initiative">WAI</abbr></span>
 is a work-in-progress document that describes issues caused by 
significant responsive changes. It encourages designers to “maintain 
point of regard” during responsive changes (the “point of regard” is the
 place a reader is looking at). Unfortunately, it’s not always possible 
to “guess” whether the point of regard is the main content or a sidebar.</p>
			<h3 id="sidebar-alternatives" tabindex="-1">Sidebar alternatives</h3>
			<p>Common items in sidebars include tag clouds, an author bio, and an
 index of entries; these aren’t useful while reading an article. 
Consider putting them in the article footer or—even better—dedicated 
pages. This does mean that readers will have to navigate to a different 
page to see that content, but they probably prefer things that way; 
almost nobody who clicked on “An opinionated list of best practices for 
textual websites” did so because they wanted to read my bio.</p>
			<p>Don’t boost engagement by giving readers information they didn’t 
ask for; earn engagement with good content, and let readers navigate to 
your other pages <em>after</em> they’ve decided they want to read more.</p>
			<h3 id="line-length" tabindex="-1">Line length</h3>
			<p>As words-per-line decrease (by increasing zoom or narrowing the 
viewport), line lengths grow more varied. Justifying text will cause 
uncomfortable amounts of whitespace. In fact, <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#visual-presentation">Text is not justified</q> is explicitly mentioned in the WCAG Success Criterion 1.4.8.</p>
			<p>The WCAG recommends a max line length of 80 characters (40 characters for <abbr title="Chinese, Japanese, and Korean">CJK</abbr> languages) as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#visual-presentation">a AAA success criterion (SC 1.4.8)</a>.
 However, studies seem to have mixed results; some people find it easier
 to read lines around 90 characters long, while others struggle beyond 
the 50-character mark.</p>
			<p>I think the WCAG over-simplified a complex issue to make this 
success criterion easier to understand. The guideline in its current 
form encourages wrapping lines at uneven lengths, since proportional 
text can take up varying amounts of space for a given character count. 
It would be better to specify an average character length, allowing 
lines with narrow characters (e.g. “I”, “l”) to exceed it. Then again, 
the AAA level was never intended to be a blanket requirement.</p>
			<p>Some of my links display long link-text; short line lengths can 
break these link texts too much, which can slightly hurt readability. Of
 course, narrow viewports will obviously make short line lengths 
non-negotiable. I decided to give article bodies a width of <code>36em</code>, which corresponds to just over 80 characters on most default stylesheets. I opted to use <code>em</code> instead of <code>ch</code>
 for consistency and for better compatibility with some uncommon 
browsers (NetSurf, Dillo, old versions of mainstream browsers, and 
others).</p>
			<p>I also ensured that my site supports CSS overrides, 
window-resizing, zoom levels past 200%, and most “reading mode” 
implementations. This should help accommodate a wide range of 
line-length preferences while still looking accessible enough by 
default.</p>
			<p>When setting max line lengths, use a CSS media query to ensure 
that printed versions of a page use the full page width. This should 
save some paper.</p>

			<h3 id="narrow-viewports-are-popular" tabindex="-1">Narrow viewports are popular</h3>
			<p>Not every phone has a giant screen: millions of people around the 
world use Web-enabled feature phones. The Jio Phone&nbsp;2, for 
instance, is narrow enough to fall through a belt loop: it sports a 
screen that’s just over 3.6&nbsp;cm (1.44&nbsp;inches) wide. 
Furthermore, some programs sport browser windows in sidebars (c.f. 
Mozilla’s <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/side-view/">side view</a>, Vivaldi <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/desktop/panels/web-panels/">Web Panels</a>). Users who leverage floating or tiling windows rather than maximizing everything could use viewports of arbitrary dimensions.</p>
			<p>Nowadays, even tiny smartwatches have built-in browsers; users who
 navigate to links in smartwatch message and email apps will use 
simplified browsers that fit on their wrists. Apple published a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/239/">video about WebKit on WatchOS</a> (here’s <a href="https://brucelawson.co.uk/2018/the-practical-value-of-semantic-html/">a text summary of the video</a>,
 starting at the “New types of devices” section). The Apple Watch Series
 6 has a viewport that’s 162 CSS pixels wide; it emulates an iPhone’s 
viewport and shows a zoomed-out version of the page unless the page 
includes a “device-adjust” meta tag, the same way phones emulate desktop
 viewports without a “viewport” meta tag. Samsung Internet is a popular 
option for Wear OS users, whose viewports are often just 150 CSS pixels.</p>
			<h3 id="wide-items" tabindex="-1">Wide items</h3>
			<p>A single element wider than the viewport will trigger horizontal 
scrolling for the entire page. This is especially problematic for long 
pages that already require excessive vertical scrolling.</p>
			<p>Long words, especially in headings, can trigger horizontal overflow. Test in a viewport that’s under 240 pixels wide (<abbr title="Device Pixel Ratio">DPR</abbr>=1) and observe any words that trail off of the edge of the screen. Add soft hyphens to these words using the <code>&amp;shy;</code> entity.</p>
			<p>Most modern browsers support the <code>hyphens</code> CSS&nbsp;3 
property, but full automatic hyphenation is usually an overkill solution
 with a naive implementation. Automatic hyphenation will insert hyphens 
wherever it can, not necessarily between the best syllables. At the time
 of writing, humans are still better at hyphenating than most software 
implementations. I only enable full hyphenation on the narrowest of 
viewports.</p>
			<p>Users employing machine translation will not benefit from your 
soft hyphens, so don’t expect them to always work as intended. 
Translation tools might also replace short words with long ones. Soft 
hyphens and automatic hyphenation are both flawed solutions, but I find 
soft hyphens to be less problematic.</p>
			<p>Where long inline <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> elements can trigger horizontal scrolling, consider a scrollable <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>
 element instead. Making a single element horizontally scrollable is far
 better than making the entire page scrollable in two dimensions. 
Hard-wrap code blocks so that they won’t horizontally scroll in most 
widescreen desktop browsers.</p>
			<p>Be sure to test your hyphens with NVDA or Windows Narrator: these 
screen readers’ pronunciation of words can be disrupted by poorly-placed
 hyphens. Balancing the need to adapt to narrow screens against the need
 to sound correctly to a screen reader is a complex matter.<sup><a href="#fn:29" id="fnref:29" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;29</a></sup>
 The best place to insert a hyphen is between compound words. For 
example, splitting “Firefighter” into “Fire-fighter” is quite safe. 
Beyond that, try listening to hyphenated words in NVDA to ensure they 
remain clear.</p>
			<h3 id="keeping-text-together" tabindex="-1">Keeping text together</h3>
			<p>Soft hyphens are great for splitting up text, but some text should
 stay together. The phrase “10&nbsp;cm”, for instance, would flow poorly
 if “10” and “cm” appeared on separate lines. Splitting text becomes 
especially painful on narrow viewports. A non-breaking space keeps the 
surrounding text from being re-flowed. Use the <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> HTML entity instead of a space: <code>10&amp;nbsp;cm</code>. <span class="h-cite" itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Book"><cite itemprop="name" class="p-name"><a class="u-url" itemprop="url" href="https://practicaltypography.com/">Practical Typography</a></cite> by <span itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person" class="h-card vcard p-author"><a itemprop="url" href="https://mbtype.com/bio.html" class="u-url url"><span itemprop="name" class="p-name fn n"><span itemprop="givenName" class="p-given-name given-name">Matthew</span> <span itemprop="familyName" class="p-family-name family-name">Butterick</span></span></a></span></span>, describes <a href="https://briefs.video/videos/is-progressive-enhancement-dead-yet/">where to use the non-breaking space</a> in more detail.</p>
			<p>One exception to the rules from <cite>Practical Typography</cite>:
 don’t use a non-breaking space if it would trigger two-dimensional 
scrolling on a narrow viewport. Between broken text and two-dimensional 
scrolling, broken text is the lesser evil. I personally set a cutoff at 
2.5&nbsp;cm (1&nbsp;inch) at 125% zoom.</p>
			<h3 id="pictures-of-text" tabindex="-1">Pictures of text</h3>
			<p>You should only use pictures of text when the visual presentation 
of the text is part of the information you’re trying to convey. Always 
be sure to test how such an image looks on a narrow screen.</p>
			<p>Images do not reflow their text. When the viewport is narrower 
than the image dimensions, you can instruct the browser to do one of 
three things:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Allow the image to exceed the viewport width, triggering two-dimensional scrolling for the whole page.</li>
				<li>Shrink the image to fit the viewport, causing the text in the image to shrink with it.</li>
				<li>Allow the image to horizontally overflow.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>I already covered the first option in the prior subsection. If you
 expect viewers to read the text in the image and you don’t link an 
image transcript, the second option isn’t ideal. Overflow is almost 
never what we want.</p>
			<p>The best compromise is to ensure that the image isn’t too wide, 
and can support large text on a narrow viewport. Lines of text in images
 should contain as few characters as possible. For a good example, see 
the “<a href="#in-defense-of-link-underlines">In defense of link underlines</a>” section.</p>
			<p>If the text needs to be readable, <a href="#contrast-is-complex">check its APCA levels</a>. At large sizes, the contrast shouldn’t be too high; at small sizes, it shouldn’t be too low.</p>
			<h3 id="indented-elements" tabindex="-1">Indented elements</h3>
			<p>Most browser default stylesheets were not optimized for narrow 
viewports, so narrow-viewport optimization is one of few good reasons to
 override the defaults. The best example of widescreen bias in browser 
stylesheets is indentation.</p>
			<p>The HTML standard’s section 4.4.4 <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-blockquote-element">covers blockquotes</a>. It recommends placing a <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> element inside a <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> and citations in a <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> to show a semantic relationship between a quotation and its citation.</p>
			<p>Browser default stylesheets typically give <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> elements extra margins on either side. <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>
 elements have a large indent. Combining these two properties gives the 
final quotation an excessive visual indent, wasting precious vertical 
screen space. When quoted text contains list elements (<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>), the indentation alone may fill most of a narrow viewport!</p>
			<p>I chose to remove the margins in <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> 
elements for quotations and code snippets. If you’re reading this page 
with its own stylesheet enabled, in a CSS&nbsp;2 compliant browser, you 
might have noticed the blockquotes on it have a minimal indent and a 
thick border on the left rather than a full indent. These two 
adjustments allow blockquotes containing bulleted lists to fit on most 
narrow viewports, even when wrapped by a <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element.</p>
			<p>Indented elements can be difficult to distinguish when nested. A <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> may not be visible if it contains an <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>. My left-border approach resolves this ambiguity.</p>
			<p>Another example: outside the Web, I prefer indenting code with 
tabs instead of spaces. Tab widths are user-configurable, while spaces 
aren’t. HTML pre-formatted code blocks, however, are best indented with 
two spaces. Default browser stylesheets typically represent tabs with an
 excessive indent, which can be annoying on narrow viewports.</p>
			<h3 id="short-viewports" tabindex="-1">Short viewports</h3>
			<p>Designers often use figures to “break up” their content, and 
provide negative space. This is good advice, but I don’t think people 
pay enough attention to the flipside: splitting up content with too many
 figures can make reading extremely painful on a short viewport. Design 
maxims usually lack nuance.</p>
			<p>Small phones typically support display rotation. When phones 
switch to landscape-mode, vertical space becomes precious. Fixed 
elements (e.g. dickbars) become a major usability hazard. Ironically, 
the WCAG’s own interactive Techniques reference is a perfect example of 
how fixed elements impact usability on short screens.</p>

			<p>The previous <a href="#small-viewports">“small viewports” section</a> may tempt you to make your content as dense as possible. Please don’t overdo it.</p>
			<p>There’s an ideal range somewhere between “cramped” and

 resolve such difficult and subjective issues is to ask your readers for
 feedback, giving disproportionate weight to readers with

			<h3 id="non-interactive-space" tabindex="-1">Non-interactive space</h3>
			<p><a href="#indented-elements">Excessive indentation makes reading difficult</a> on narrow viewports, but preserving some indentation is still useful.</p>
			<p>For now, I’ve decided to keep some indentation on list elements (<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>) since I often fill them with links (see this article’s <a href="#TableOfContents">table of contents</a> for an example).

			<p>Readers with hand tremors depend on this space to scroll without accidentally selecting an interactive element; <span class="h-cite" itemprop="citation" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting"><span itemprop="publisher">Axess Lab</span> described the issue in <cite itemprop="name headline" class="p-name"><a class="u-url" itemprop="url" href="https://axesslab.com/hand-tremors/">Hand Tremors and the giant button problem</a></cite></span>.
 Readers who double-tap to jump or zoom can’t do so if there’s no screen
 region that’s “safe to tap”. Having clearly distinguished links also 
helps users decide safe places to tap the screen; see the <a href="#in-defense-of-link-underlines">section on link underlines</a> for more information.</p>

			<h3 id="tap-targets" tabindex="-1">Tap targets</h3>
			<p>Tap targets should be at least 44 pixels tall and wide <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#target-size-enhanced">according to the WCAG</a>;
 this is large enough to easily tap on a touchscreen. The WCAG makes an 
exception for inline targets, like links in a paragraph.</p>
			<p><a href="https://web.dev/tap-targets/" id="google-tap-target">Google has more aggressive tap-target recommendations</a>:
 it recommends raising the limit 48&nbsp;px with with 8&nbsp;px gaps, 
going so far as to make tap target size a ranking factor in search.</p>
			<p>The edges of a touch screen are often tap-targets (the top edge 
might toggle navigation or scroll to the top, the bottom may have 
home/back buttons, and the right side may have a scrollbar), so keep 
elements slightly away from those. Keeping away from edges is doubly 
important on phones: they may have rounded edges that are easy to 
miss-tap, or reinforced cases that make the very edge of a screen 
difficult to reach.</p>
			<p>On lists with many links, I had to find other ways to ensure 
adequate tap-target size and provide sufficient non-interactive space

			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>The <a href="#webmentions">webmention list</a> after this article separates links with timestamps and some paragraph spacing.</p>

			</aside>
			<p>Fully standards-compliant browsers aren’t the only programs people use. They also use “reading mode” tools and services.</p>
			<p>Reading modes leverage article extractors such as <span translate="no"><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/readability">Readability</a></span> (integrated into Firefox, Epiphany, Brave, Vivaldi, and others), <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/dom-distiller/">DOM Distiller</a> (integrated into Chromium), <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/tree/master/components/speedreader/rust/lib">Brave SpeedReader</a>, and <a href="https://trafilatura.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Trafilatura</a>
 (powers a variety of tools and services). A host of other proprietary 
options exist: Diffbot powers services like Instapaper, Mozilla’s Pocket
 has its own secret parsers, and countless “send to e-reader” services 
have amassed loyal users. Safari’s proprietary fork of <span translate="no">Readability</span> has grown quite complex compared to upstream; Edge’s Immersive Reader is <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/discussions/documentation-on-huerestics-used-during-article-distillation-in/m-p/3266436">a mystery to me</a>, with <a href="https://feedbackportal.microsoft.com/feedback/idea/e0d9b299-e3b6-ec11-a81c-000d3a7ce453">a problematic stylesheet</a>.</p>
			<p>I don’t recommend catering to each tool’s non-standard quirks. 
Studying their design reveals that they observe open standards, to 
varying degrees. <span translate="no">Readability</span>, DOM Distiller, and Trafilatura understand plain-old, semantic HTML (<abbr title="Plain-Old, Semantic HTML">POSH</abbr>).</p>
			<p>POSH should be enough for most use-cases, but some authors want to
 go further. For example, they may want a byline or published date to 
show up in these modes.</p>
			<p>Most extractors fetch these values using open standards for structured data. The most well-supported option is <a href="https://microformats.org/wiki/microformats">microformats</a> (<span translate="no">Readability</span> is one of the few that supports the newer microformats2). Some support <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a> vocabularies in microdata or JSON-LD syntaxes, or <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a> vocabularies in RDFa. Most parse <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags from the document <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, but others don’t due to misuse and overly aggressive <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>.</p>
			<p>Sorry, that was a lot of jargon for a single paragraph. 
Unfortunately, describing those terms is out of scope for this post. If 
you’d like to dive down this rabbit hole, read about the “Semantic Web”.</p>
			<p>Some reading-mode implementations also support <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria-1.1/">DPUB-ARIA</a>,
 but I’d caution against using ARIA when POSH is sufficient: “bad ARIA” 
can be far more harmful to screen readers than “no ARIA”. Only use ARIA 
to fill in gaps left by POSH.</p>
			<p>Again: avoid catering to non-standard implementations’ quirks, 
especially undocumented proprietary ones. Let’s not repeat the history 
of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">browser wars</a>.
 Remember that some implementations have bugs; consider reporting issues
 when one arises. More information about standard and non-standard 
behavior of reading modes is in the article <span class="h-cite" itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting"><cite itemprop="name headline" class="p-name"><a class="u-url" itemprop="url" href="https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/browser-reading-mode-parsers.html">Web Reading Mode: The non-standard rendering mode</a></cite> by <span itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person" class="h-card vcard p-author"><a itemprop="url" href="https://www.daniel.priv.no/" class="u-url url"><span itemprop="name" class="p-name fn n"><span itemprop="givenName" class="p-given-name given-name">Daniel</span> <span itemprop="familyName" class="p-family-name family-name">Aleksandersen</span></span></a></span></span>.</p>
			<p>Reading modes aren’t the only non-browser user agents out there. 
Plain-text feed readers and link previewers are some other options. I 
singled out reading modes because of their widespread adoption and 
value. Decide which other kinds of agents are important to you (if any),
 and see if they expose a hole in your semantics.</p>
			<h2 id="machine-translation" tabindex="-1">Machine translation</h2>

			</aside>
			<p>Believe it or not, the entire world doesn’t speak your website’s 
languages. Browsers like Chromium, Microsoft Edge, and Safari have 
integrated machine translation to translate entire pages. Users can also
 leverage online website translators such as Google Translate or Bing. 
These “webpage translators” are far more complex than their plain-text 
predecessors.</p>
			<p>Almost every word on your site can be re-written. Prepare for 
headings to change length, paragraphs to grow and shrink, or hyphenation
 to disappear. Your site’s layout should make sense even when the length
 of each textual element is changed.</p>
			<p>Machines can’t reliably translate images of text, since OCR is error-prone. See the <a href="#image-transcripts">image transcripts section</a> for remedies.</p>
			<p>Incorrect spelling and poor grammar in an original work can reduce
 the accuracy of a machine-translated derivative. Be sure to proofread.</p>
			<h3 id="posh-helps-translation-engines" tabindex="-1">POSH helps translation engines</h3>
			<p>To ensure that pages get machine-translated properly, make proper use of semantic HTML. Daniel wrote about this topic too in <cite><a href="https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/html-semantic-improve-machine-translation.html">Semantic markup improves the quality of machine-translated texts</a></cite>; I highly encourage giving his article a read.</p>
			<p>Elements to pay close attention to include <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;samp&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;var&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;address&gt;</code>. The semantic information conveyed by these elements supplies important context to translation algorithms.</p>
			<p>Only after <abbr title="Plain-Old, Semantic HTML">POSH</abbr> is insufficient should you attempt to “override” behavior with the <code>translate</code> HTML attribute. Setting <code>translate="no"</code> or <code>translate="yes"</code> should override the behavior of standards-compliant translation engines. If you’re unsure whether or not to use a <code>translate</code> attribute, search the relevant word or phrase on <a href="https://www.keybot.com/">Keybot</a> to see how human translators approached it.</p>
			<p>For example: machine translation will leave <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;samp&gt;</code> blocks as-is. Perhaps you could annotate comments within code with a <code>translate="yes"</code> attribute. However, translation engines should leave variables within those comments as-is.</p>
			<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/style/placeholders">Google’s style guide</a> recommends annotating format placeholders in code blocks with the <code>&lt;var&gt;</code> element; consider doing so and adding a <code>translate="yes"</code> attribute to placeholder values, at your discretion. For an example, check this article’s code sample <a href="#png-pipeline">describing my PNG optimization pipeline</a>. Most implementations do not yet support <code>translate="yes"</code> embedded inside untranslated blocks, but I’m counting on this changing.</p>
			<h3 id="changing-text-direction" tabindex="-1">Changing text direction</h3>
			<p>Consider the implications of translating between left-to-right 
(LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) languages. Do a search through your 
stylesheets for keywords like “left” and “right” to ensure that styles 
don’t depend too heavily on text direction. Once you’ve cleared the 
low-hanging fruit, try translating the page to a language like Arabic.</p>
			<p>Websites following this page’s layout advice shouldn’t need much adjustment. <span class="h-cite" itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/TechArticle"><span itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person" class="h-card vcard p-author"><a itemprop="url" href="https://ishadeed.com/" class="u-url url"><span itemprop="name" class="p-name fn n"><span itemprop="givenName" class="p-given-name given-name">Ahmed</span> <span itemprop="familyName" class="p-family-name family-name">Shadeed</span></span>’s</a></span><cite itemprop="name headline" class="p-name"><a class="u-url" itemprop="url" href="https://rtlstyling.com/posts/rtl-styling/">RTL Styling 101</a></cite></span> is a comprehensive guide to what can go wrong and how to fix issues.</p>
			<h3 id="current-limitations" tabindex="-1">Current limitations</h3>
			<p>Machine translation is always improving. Today, it has some limitations which I expect will be resolved with time.</p>
			<p><code>translate="yes"</code> attributes nested inside un-translated blocks (code snippets, blocks with <code>translate="no"</code>, etc.) are not yet supported by most translation tools. It’s a relatively new attribute, so flaky support is understandable.</p>
			<p>Machine translators often skip <code>aria-label</code> and <code>aria-description</code>. For this reason, authors prefer using <code>aria-labelledby</code> and <code>aria-describedby</code> instead.</p>
			<p>Microsoft Edge is the only browser I know of to adjust text-direction during translation, but it breaks when faced with inline <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements.</p>

			</aside>
			<p>Simple sites should err on the side of respecting default 
stylesheets. With rare exceptions, there are only two times I feel 
comfortable overriding default stylesheets:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Gently adjusting a parameter rather than completely changing an 
element’s appearance. Typically, this involves adjusting dimensions.</li>
				<li>Fundamentally altering an element’s appearance. I only feel 
comfortable doing this when the defaults are truly inaccessible, or 
clash with another accessibility enhancement I made.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>My previous advice regarding line spacing and maximum line length fell in the first category. My approach to re-styling <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> elements, adding borders, and using <code>sans-serif</code> fell in the latter category.</p>
			<p>This section contains miscellaneous advice regarding the latter category of stylesheet overrides.</p>
			<h3 id="monospace-handling" tabindex="-1">Mono­space handling</h3>
			<p>By default, most browsers render monospace text at a reduced size.
 If you want your monospace text to be readable, set its font family to <code>monospace, monospace</code> (sic).</p>
			<p>Font family alone is not enough to distinguish an element from its surroundings. For <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;samp&gt;</code> elements, I recommend supplementing the font family change with a soft border. As described in <a href="#color-overrides-and-accessibility">the “Color overrides and accessibility” section</a>,
 borders are preferable to background colors because they don’t override
 the user-agent’s preferred foreground and background colors.</p>
			<p>Finally, it’s important to distinguish <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> from <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;samp&gt;</code>, and regular body text.</p>

			<p>On one hand, users who need enhanced focus visibility may override
 the default focus indicators in their browser preferences; I’d like to 
support such overrides. On the other hand, relying on these 
customizations would violate the “accessible by default” directive. This
 would exclude Tor Browser and fingerprinting-averse readers, as well as
 anybody who has to borrow a machine or browser they don’t own or 
haven’t customized yet. This is another one of the few areas where I’d 
recommend overriding browser default stylesheets.</p>
			<p>The WCAG <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/#focus-appearance-enhanced">Success Criterion 2.4.12</a>
 recommends making focus indicators 2&nbsp;px thick. While this success 
criterion is only AAA-level, it’s easy enough to meet and beneficial 
enough to others that we should all meet it.</p>
			<p>You can use <code>:focus</code> and <code>:focus-visible</code> to
 highlight selected and keyboard-focused elements, respectively. Take 
care to only alter styling, not behavior: only keyboard-focusable 
elements should receive outlines. Modern browser stylesheets use <code>:focus-visible</code> instead of <code>:focus</code>; old browsers only support <code>:focus</code> and re-style a subset of focusable elements. Your stylesheets should do the same, to match browser behavior.<sup><a href="#fn:30" id="fnref:30" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;30</a></sup></p>

			<h3 id="split-elements-and-possessive-hyperlinks" tabindex="-1">Split elements and possessive hyperlinks</h3>
			<p>Some screen readers split up sections by HTML elements. This means
 HTML elements in the middle of a sentence will trigger pauses. The 
problem comes up frequently on sites that use excessive inline 
formatting.</p>
			<p>This is especially concerning on my website, where I tend to 
hyperlink peoples’ names (a common practice on the IndieWeb): making 
names possessive with an “apostrophe + s” creates pronunciation issues. 
“Seirdy’s Home” could be read as “Seirdy. Link. S. Home” if the word 
“Seirdy” is a hyperlink.</p>
			<p>A workaround is to use the “text” ARIA role to remove the 
semantics of elements. This workaround doesn’t work in certain screen 
readers, including Orca, so don’t count on it.</p>

			<p>If you’re unfamiliar with ARIA, always remember the <dfn id="first-rule-of-aria" tabindex="-1">First Rule of ARIA</dfn>: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#no_aria_better_bad_aria">No ARIA is better than Bad ARIA</a>.
 ARIA exposes a host of accessibility hazards when used improperly, so 
only use this approach when there’s no good alternative. Furthermore, <code>role="text"</code> isn’t actually standard ARIA; its proposed inclusion into the ARIA specification was controversial. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria/issues/870#issuecomment-589282781">issue 870 of WAI-ARIA</a> for some problems with it.</p>
			<p>The best solution for possessive nouns is to include the “apostrophe + s” inside the hyperlink.</p>
			<h3 id="other-tips-for-screen-readers" tabindex="-1">Other tips for screen readers</h3>
			<p>Designers already test their websites with multiple browser 
engines to ensure cross-browser compatibility. Screen readers deserve 
the same treatment. Orca, VoiceOver, NVDA, Narrator, JAWS, TalkBack, 
ChromeVox, KaiOS Readout, et al. all have unique behavior. In addition, 
different browsers—even different Chromium forks—expose content to 
screen readers differently. You’ll need to test multiple screen readers 
in multiple browsers, and keep track of updates to both. See why 
standards compliance is important?</p>
			<p>Screen readers on touch screen devices are also quite different 
from their desktop counterparts, and typically feature fewer 
capabilities. Be sure to test on both desktop and mobile.</p>
			<p>Screen reader implementations often skip punctuation marks like 
the exclamation point ("!"). Ensure that meaning doesn’t rely too 
heavily on such punctuation.</p>
			<p>Screen readers have varying levels of verbosity. The default verbosity level doesn’t always convey inline emphasis, such as <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>. Ensure that your meaning carries through without these semantics.<sup><a href="#fn:31" id="fnref:31" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;31</a></sup></p>
			<p>Default verbosity does, however, convey symbols and emoji. Use 
symbols and emoji judiciously, since they can get pretty noisy if you 
aren’t careful. Use <code>aria-labelledby</code> on symbols when appropriate; I used labels to mark my footnote backlinks, which would otherwise be read as <samp>right arrow curving left</samp>.
 If you have to use a symbol or emoji, first test how assistive 
technologies announce it; the emoji name may not communicate what you 
expect.</p>
			<p>Beware of <code>display</code> and <code>visibility</code> CSS properties; they can interfere with content reported to screen readers (see <a href="#display-props">quote from Steve Faulkner</a>). Whenever you use one of those properties, re-test with screen readers just to be safe.</p>
			<figure itemprop="mentions" id="display-props" tabindex="-1" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Quotation">
				<blockquote itemprop="text">
					<p>Sometimes [using <code>display</code> properties] can have an 
unintended effect of nuking the semantics of the elements, as conveyed 
to screen reading software, in the <a href="https://www.tpgi.com/the-browser-accessibility-tree/">browser accessibility tree</a>.
 Screen readers and other assistive tech, in general, do not have direct
 access to the HTML DOM, they are provided access to a subset of 
information in the HTML DOM via <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#dfn-accessibility-api">Accessibility APIs</a>. Sometimes what an element represents in the HTML DOM is not how it is represented in the accessibility tree.</p>
					<p>If what is represented in the accessibility tree does not 
represent the developer’s intended UI, it’s either (wittingly / 
unwittingly) the <strong>fault of the developer or the browser</strong>. But what we can be sure of, in these cases, is that it is <strong>not the fault of the screen reader</strong>.</p>

			<p>If your site is simple enough, it should automatically handle the

			<p>No matter how simple a page is, I don’t think simplicity

			<p>Automated tests—especially accessibility tests—are a supplement to
 manual tests, not a replacement for them. Think of them as time-savers 
that bring up issues for further research, containing both false 
positives and false negatives.</p>
			<p>These are the tools I use regularly. I’ve deliberately excluded tools that would be redundant.<sup><a href="#fn:32" id="fnref:32" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;32</a></sup></p>

					<a href="https://validator.nu/">Nu HTML checker</a>
				</dt>
				<dd>The W3C’s official HTML validator. Valid HTML ensures broader 
compatibility with a wider range of agents. Note that it uses Jigsaw 
under the hood for CSS validation, which hasn’t implemented support for 
certain CSS features I’ve recommended elsewhere on this page. Watch out 
for false positives.</dd>
				<dt>
					<a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core">axe-core</a>

auditors that run accessibility checks use this library under the hood.</dd>
				<dt>
					<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">
						<span id="lighthouse">Lighthouse</span>
					</a>
				</dt>
				<dd>An auditing tool by Google that uses the DevTools protocol in 
any Chromium-based browser. Skip the “Access­ibility” category, since it
 just runs a subset of axe-core’s audits. The most useful audit is the 
tap target size check in its “SEO” category. It’s also convenient for 
measuring performance with CPU throttling, to simulate low-end mobile 
devices. Note that your <code>sandbox</code> CSP directive will need to include <code>allow-scripts</code> for it to function.</dd>
				<dt>
					<a href="https://webhint.io/">Webhint</a>
				</dt>
				<dd>Similar to Lighthouse. Again, you can ignore the accessibility 
audits if you already use axe-core. I personally disagree with some of 
its hints: the “unneeded HTTP headers” hint ignores the fact that the 
CSP can have an effect on non-hypertext assets, the “HTTP cache” hint 
has an unreasonable bias against caching HTML, and the “Correct <code>Content-Type</code> header” recommends charset attributes a bit too agg­ressively.<sup><a href="#fn:33" id="fnref:33" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;33</a></sup></dd>
				<dt>
					<a href="https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/verify/automated/">IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker</a>

				<dd>a Firefox addon that displays audits in the sidebar. In my 
experience, it does have many false-positives (especially regarding 
DPUB-ARIA); however, it has caught a few issues missed by all other 
tools.</dd>
				<dt>
					<a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/accessibility_inspector/index.html#check-for-accessibility-issues">Firefox’s Accessibility Inspector</a>
				</dt>
				<dd>supports some very basic audits for contrast, keyboard access, 
and text labels. The accessibility tree is also a useful way to ensure 
that elements have accessible names. The keyboard audits have 
false-positives on non-interactive horizontally-scrollable elements, 
which need to be focusable.</dd>
				<dt>
					<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css-overview/">Chromium’s CSS Overview</a>
				</dt>
				<dd>can show some basic accessibility violations, including contrast

the DevTools experimental settings first. Note that this uses an earlier
 version of APCA and does not account for contrast that is too high.</dd>

			<h3 id="unorthodox-tests" tabindex="-1">Unorthodox tests</h3>
			<p>In addition to standard testing, I recommend testing with 
unorthodox setups that are unlikely to be found in the wild. If a 
website doesn’t work well in one of these tests, there’s a good chance 
that it uses an advanced Web feature that can serve as a point of 
failure in other cases. Simple sites should be able to look good in a 
variety of situations out of the box.</p>
			<p>Your page should easily pass the harshest of tests without any 
extra effort if its HTML meets basic standards for well-written code 
(overlooking bad formatting and a lack of comments). Even if you use a 
complex static site generator, the final HTML should be simple, 
readable, and semantic.</p>
			<p>These tests begin reasonably, but gradually grow absurd. Once again, use your judgement.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Test in all three major browser engines: Blink, Gecko, and WebKit.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Evaluate the heaviness and complexity of your scripts (if any) by testing with your browser’s <abbr title="just-in-time">JIT</abbr> compilation disabled.<sup><a href="#fn:34" id="fnref:34" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;34</a></sup></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Test using the Tor Browser’s safest security level enabled (disables JS and other features).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Load just the HTML. No CSS, no images, etc. Try loading without inline CSS as well for good measure.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Print some pages in black-and-white, preferably with a simple laser printer.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Test with assistive technologies such as screen readers, magnifiers, and switch controls.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Ensure the page responds correctly to browser zoom. No sizes or dimensions should remain “fixed” across zoom levels.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Test keyboard navigability with the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key and caret
 navigation. Even without specifying tab indexes, tab selection should 
follow a logical order if you keep the layout simple.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Test in textual browsers: lynx, links, w3m, ELinks, edbrowse, EWW, Netrik, etc.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Test in an online website translator tool.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Test your feeds (RSS, Atom, JSON, etc.) in multiple readers to 
ensure they render your markup correctly. Microsoft Outlook uses Word’s 
Internet-Explorer-based HTML engine to display these contents; Newsboat 
uses its own custom HTML renderer. Most don’t support CSS.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Read the (prettified and indented) HTML source itself and parse 
it with your brain. See if anything seems illogical or unnecessary. 
Imagine giving someone a printout of your page’s <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
 along with a whiteboard. If they have a basic knowledge of HTML tags, 
would they be able to draw something resembling your website?</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Test with unorthodox graphical browser engines, like NetSurf, Dillo, Servo, or the Serenity OS browser.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Test how your page renders in ancient browsers, like Netscape 
Navigator or Tkhtml. Use a TLS terminator or serve over HTTP from 
localhost.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Try printing out your page in black-and-white from an unorthodox graphical browser.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Download your webpage and test how multiple word processors render and generate PDFs from it.<sup><a href="#fn:35" id="fnref:35" role="doc-noteref">note&nbsp;35</a></sup></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Combine conversion tools. Combine an HTML-<wbr>to-<wbr>EPUB converter and an EPUB-<wbr>to-<wbr>PDF
 converter, or stack multiple article-extraction utilities. Be creative 
and enjoy breaking your site. When something breaks, examine the 
breakage and see if it’s caused by an issue in your markup, or a CSS 
feature with an equivalent alternative.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Build a time machine. Travel decades—or perhaps centuries—into 
the future. Keep going forward until the WWW is breathing its last 
breath. Test your site on future browsers. Figuring out how to transfer 
your files onto their computers might take some time, but you have a 
time machine so that shouldn’t be too hard. When you finish, go back in 
time to <a href="https://xkcd.com/567/">meet Benjamin Franklin</a>.</p>

			<p>Each of these may be dismissed as a “niche”, especially given a profit motive (or worse, a growth imperative). Yet <em>many niches add up to a large population.</em> Every person who grows old becomes disabled; every long-distance traveller experiences poor connections.</p>
			<p>Moreover, I don’t think that the size of a disadvantaged 
population should always matter. I understand weighing population size 
if you have to make a trade-off between two conflicting special needs, 
but I don’t think the aesthetic preferences of the majority are more 
important than supporting a disadvantaged minority.</p>

 take another skim through this page. Notice how much repetition exists 
between sections. <em>Nearly every bullet-point I listed benefits tremendously from plain-old, semantic HTML (<abbr title="Plain-Old, Semantic HTML">POSH</abbr>)</em>. If your page is usable with nothing but POSH, you’ve done half the work already.</p>

				<p>If you’ve got some time on your hands, I <em>highly</em> recommend reading the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)&nbsp;2.2</a></cite>. The WCAG 2 standard is technology-neutral, so it doesn’t contain Web-specific advice. For that, check the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref">How to Meet WCAG (Quick Reference)</a></cite>. It combines the WCAG with its supplementary <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/">list of techniques</a>.</p>
				<p>The WCAG are an excellent starting point for learning about 
accessibility, but make for a poor stopping point. Much of the content 
on this page simply isn’t covered by the WCAG. One of my favorite 
resources for learning about what the WCAG <em>doesn’t</em> cover is <a href="https://axesslab.com/articles/">Axess Lab’s articles</a>.</p>
				<p>I’ve learned about a great number of under­represented ways to browse from the Fediverse, particularly from <a href="https://pleroma.envs.net/notice/AHqp3TEDFoyz0W4nbc">this subthread asking people to share</a> (requires JavaScript; <a href="https://gopher.envs.net/pleroma.envs.net:7070/1/notices/AHqp3TEDFoyz0W4nbc">plaintext mirror</a>). Several responses informed updates to this page.</p>

						<p>Many addons function by injecting content into pages; this 
significantly weakens many aspects of the browser security model (e.g. 
site and origin isolation) and should be avoided if at all possible. For
 content such as public key fingerprints, I recommend setting a blank <code>sandbox</code> directive even if it means breaking these addons.&nbsp;</p>

						<p>Some addons will have reduced functionality; for instance, <a href="https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl">Tridactyl</a> can’t create an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>
 for its command window. I consider this to be worthwhile since the most
 important functionality is still available, and because authors 
shouldn’t feel compelled to support security weakening. I say this as 
someone who uses Tridactyl often.</p>
						<p>Moreover, the <code>sandbox</code> directive exposes some bugs in WebKit (i.e. Safari and most GTK-based browsers). On content governed by a <code>sandbox</code> directive without the <code>allow-same origin</code> and <code>allow-scripts</code> directives, some WebKit browser features won’t work. One example is media controls. One page on my site has an <code>audio</code> element; I added <code>allow-scripts</code> to that page so it will work in WebKit-based browsers. <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=237281">WebKit bug 237281 documents the general issue</a>; <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225865">WebKit bug 225865</a> and <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=218086">WebKit bug 218086</a> document specific instances.&nbsp;</p>

						<p>HPACK and QPACK header compression includes dictionaries

 If these dictionaries contain a given header name or name-value pair, 
the header name/value’s effective size can be reduced to a single byte. 
If a header has a value that isn’t covered by the table, consider 
minifying it by removing unnecessary whitespace.</p>

						<p>I find it quite odd that Microsoft Edge doesn’t support AVIF. 
Chromium has supported AVIF for a long time, and Edge is based on 
Chromium. AVIF is a royalty-free format; I don’t know why Microsoft 
would remove support for it, especially since Microsoft allows adding 
AVIF support to Windows. I think Edge also removed Chromium’s 
experimental, off-by-default support for JPEG-XL.&nbsp;</p>
